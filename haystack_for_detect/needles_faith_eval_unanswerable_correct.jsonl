The Council acts as a catalyst for many legislative initiatives, while the Parliament can request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal; however, the Commission can reject such a suggestion, giving reasons. The Commission's President (currently an ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker) sets the agenda for the EU's work. Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, usually through a 'written procedure' of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.[citation needed] Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (currently Federica Mogherini).

The Commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament.

{"question": "How can any knot be distinctively indicated?", "context": "The concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, \"prime\" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Prime models and prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.", "qID": "0a6467830eb84388a6ad5dfe6965dbd8"}

Glaucophytes have chloroplasts that retain a peptidoglycan wall between their double membranes, like their cyanobacterial parent. Glaucophyte chloroplasts also contain concentric unstacked thylakoids, which surround a carboxysome - an icosahedral structure that glaucophyte chloroplasts and cyanobacteria keep their carbon fixation enzyme rubisco in. The starch that they synthesize collects outside the chloroplast. Like cyanobacteria, glaucophyte chloroplast thylakoids are studded with light collecting structures called phycobilisomes.

{"question": "How do you determine the acceleration of a rope when two people are pulling it?", "context": "Forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as \"vector quantities\". This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other.", "qID": "b698405bb51f4cf1b6036474fde14ad9"}

Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium \"natural state\" in place of the Aristotelian idea of the \"natural state of rest\". That is, the first law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity. By making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity, Newton's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities. Specifically, in systems where objects are moving with different velocities, it is impossible to determine which object is \"in motion\" and which object is \"at rest\".", "qID": "59a5d5ebe9aa4d78a053636b81733a52"}

{"question": "What could the states refuse?", "context": "(CNN) -- As Toyota recalls millions of cars, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that an average of 25 percent of U.S. consumers who get recall notices don't follow through and fix their vehicles.\n\nThe CNN Fact Check Desk wondered: Is there a way to ensure compliance with auto recalls?\n\nMost vehicle recalls involve free fixes for the consumer.\n\n• Clarence Ditlow with the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog group, says there is not a process to ensure that auto owners comply with recalls.\n\nThe center says vehicle insurers have an incentive and a method to reach car owners who haven't complied fully with recalls. \"Insurers have the VIN [vehicle identification numbers], and they could contact the insured drivers who have failed to comply,\" Ditlow says.\n\n• According to Edmunds.com, some states do require owners to make the requisite repairs before they attempt to sell the affected car.\n\n• Jeanne Salvatore, with the Insurance Information Institute, says that auto insurers will pay damage claims caused by the current Toyota defects, then go after Toyota for reimbursements.\n\n• CNN Personal Finance Editor Gerri Willis says that new car dealers are prevented from selling a defective car.\n\n• If recall communications are deemed insufficient, the NHTSA can require further efforts from the manufacturer. But there is not a mechanism at the federal level to ensure that drivers comply.\n\n• Bottom line: If the NHTSA's 25 percent noncompliance figure is any indication, there could be many affected Toyota models that do not get the requisite fix under the current recall.

Capes, director of the emergency department.\n\n\"It's common, but not incredibly common,\" he said.\n\nTypically, when stung by an insect, a person will have no reaction or a mild local reaction, such as redness, swelling or itching at the site of the sting. However, some people experience a more widespread reaction, such as a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness or hives all over. iReport.com: Send us your allergy stories\n\nIn the most serious cases, a person can go into anaphylaxis, a condition in which he or she may have difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include swelling of the mouth or throat, itchy skin, wheezing, cough and localized pain, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York.\n\nCapes advises people who experience a systemic reaction to call 911 and wait for an ambulance, because it will have medicine to treat the reaction immediately. An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and, in severe cases, a shot of epinephrine.\n\nEven if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said.\n\nThose who have had allergic reactions to insects should always carry an antihistamine and an epinephrine auto-injector for emergencies, experts said.\n\nInsect allergies may be harder to control than some food allergies because it's not always possible to predict when bees, wasps and other stinging bugs are around, Capes said.\n\nSevere reactions don't usually happen the very first time a person gets stung, Capes said.\n\n\"The thing about allergic reactions that is interesting, or scary, is that we never know what the next allergic reaction is going to be,\" he said.\n\nFor those who have a history of anaphylactic reactions to insects, vaccines are available for yellow jackets, wasps, honey bees and fire ants, Bassett said. The immunization process takes three to five years, he said.\n\nThere are also blood and skin tests that people can take to determine whether they are sensitive to these insects, he said.\n\nBesides anaphylaxis, people may experience other kinds of reactions, Bassett said. If a person is stung hundreds of times at once, he or she may need emergency care, as the venom may lead to seizures, shock and even death, he said.\n\nThere is also a rare reaction called serum sickness that includes joint pain and flu-like illness that may result from insect stings, and has allergy-like symptoms, Bassett said.\n\nIn rare cases, even mosquito bites can lead to anaphylaxis, Bassett said. There is no treatment for mosquito allergies, but there is a diagnostic test, he said.\n\nBassett offers the following tips to reduce the danger of insects:\n\n• Stay away from stinging insect nests when possible.\n\n• Consider wearing closed-toed shoes in an area where there may be many stinging insects.\n\n• Remain calm and quiet around a stinging insect, and move slowly away from it.\n\n• Avoid brightly colored clothing, as well as perfumes and scented hair products and lotions.\n\n• Avoid loose-fitting clothing, which can accidentally", "qID": "c4e4cc4c65dc49cb951576e334e7bf52"}

Shakespeare died in 1616.\n\nThe Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard.\n\nThe most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes.\n\nThe identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait.\n\nThe portrait \"shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,\" Wells said.\n\n\"It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,\" Wells said.\n\n\"There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life.\"\n\nWells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face.\n\n\"I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'\"\n\nIt should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king.\n\nThe portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.", "qID": "7a1c968d39644e7eb1f0a27e3f70c70f"}
{"question": "what does faa say", "context": "Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is changing a generations-old policy banning pilots from taking antidepressants. Beginning Monday, pilots with mild to moderate depression will be allowed to fly while taking antidepressants if they can demonstrate they have been satisfactorily treated for at least 12 months. The FAA also will begin a six-month amnesty period, during which pilots who use antidepressants can step forward without fear of penalties. The pilots will be grounded until they can demonstrate they have been stable for a year, although those who can prove a history of successful medical treatment should be able to fly 'within a few months,' the FAA said. FAA officials said that they do not know the extent of depression among pilots but that pilots are probably representative of the larger population, in which 10 percent are believed to suffer from depression. Nor does the FAA know how many pilots have removed themselves from flying status because they suffer from depression, a condition that now bars them from flying. Nor do they know how many take antidepressants in violation of FAA policy. Commercial pilots under the age of 40 are required to undergo a medical exam by an FAA-certified physician every year; those over 40, every six months. But the examination focuses largely on the pilots' physical health, and there is no formal assessment of the pilots' mental health. The FAA says pilots have a regulatory duty and professional responsibility to not fly if they know they have a physical or mental condition that makes them unsafe to fly. But the FAA concedes pilots aren't always forthcoming, especially if honesty could cost them their job. Under the new policy, the FAA will, on a case-by-case basis, issue special medical certificates to pilots who take one of four antidepressants: fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro). All four drugs can be used safely without side effects, the FAA said, and other medications will be considered as the agency gains experience and data under its new policy. FAA officials say that they have been studying the issue for a decade, and that the change comes with improvements in medication and as the stigma of depression has diminished. Between 1993 and 2002, there were 16 'aircraft-assisted suicides,' according to a National Transportation Safety Board report, as recounted in a recent FAA medical bulletin. All involved smaller aircraft. In addition, the NTSB ruled that in 1999, the pilot caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 by forcing the plane into the Atlantic Ocean, although the board could not determine the pilot's motives and did not use the term 'suicide.' The pilot's medical certificate had been renewed 10 days before the crash. All 217 on board were killed. 'Depression is a disease, and it's treatable just like any other disease.

{"question": "How many pods are being tested?", "context": "(Budget Travel) -- It's all the rage to criticize the airlines. But we found some smart, practical initiatives that point the way to a better future.\n\nThis test design for Personal Rapid Transit is part of plans for driverless pods to replace airport shuttles.\n\nDriverless pods at airports\n\nSomeday, driverless pods may be zipping passengers between an airport and its parking lots. Fully automated, pods are more convenient than shuttle buses driven by humans. They let you board when you want to, rather than wait for a bus on a fixed schedule. Punch in your destination, such as a parking lot, on a touch screen. Then leave the driving to the machine, which glides on rails at speeds of 25 mph. A bonus perk: The pods are battery powered, so they don't spew out environmentally destructive exhaust.\n\nImproved design of coach seats\n\nHong Kong based Cathay Pacific Airways has reinvented the economy-class seat: As the seat reclines, the bottom slides forward, but the back stays in place. So the passenger sitting behind doesn't have to endure a seat hovering inches from his or her chin. The new seats are especially welcome on long-distance hauls -- which happen to be routes Cathay Pacific flies regularly. American Airlines is among the other carriers reportedly interested in installing similar, slide-forward seats.\n\nIn-cabin mood lighting\n\nPoor cabin lighting on a long flight may worsen jet lag. For instance, exposure to bright light at an hour when you are ordinarily asleep can confuse your body's internal clock. But smart cabin lighting may actually help your body adjust to a new time zone -- and beat back jet lag. Virgin America has an in-cabin lighting system that subtly shifts through 12 shades of violet, including a welcoming, bright blue-purple during the day, a softer violet hue after dusk, and a deep, calming near-black on red-eyes when it's time to sleep. Elsewhere in the world, Air Canada, Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways offer mood lighting on many long-haul flights.\n\nLuggage check before you get to the airport\n\nSchlepping your bags isn't fun. It's also not necessary -- at least not in the many capital cities where you can drop checked luggage at bus or train stations and forget about it until you land at your destination. Many passengers can check bags at London's Paddington station (for Heathrow flights), Vienna's Wien Mitte station, Moscow's Kievsky Station, and Hong Kong Station. In the U.S., the best advance luggage-check option is at Walt Disney World: Guests staying at Disney lodging can check bags at their hotel before hopping on the free Magical Express ride to the Orlando airport.\n\nPaperless boarding passes  Boarding passes printed on flimsy paper seem almost as outdated as paper airline tickets. Now, cell phone check-in is allowed at many airports, such as Chicago O'Hare and Los Angeles's LAX. Punch in your phone number at check-in and a bar code appears on your phone via e-mail or text message. Security officers and gate agents scan your phone's screen, making for an entirely paperless process. Some airlines, including American, Continental, and Delta (plus its sister unit, Northwest), plan to adopt the new technology at every airport gate nationwide.\n\nMore power --sockets -- for the people\n\nSometimes it's the simple things that count. Virgin America not only became the first airline to offer Wi-Fi on every flight, but it did so in an especially sensible way, with standard sockets (no adapter necessary) at every seat on the plane.

Police say Karthik Rajaram left suicide notes taking responsibility for the murders of his family. Authorities said the man had an MBA in finance but appeared to have been unemployed for several months and had worked for major accounting firms, such as Price Waterhouse. The two-story rented home is in a gated community in Porter Ranch, about 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles. The shootings were discovered after 8:20 a.m. Monday, after a neighbor called police to report that the wife had failed to pick her up to take her to her job at a pharmacy, Deputy Chief of Police Michel Moore said. Ed Winter, assistant chief from the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, identified the suspect as Karthik Rajaram, 45. Winter said the victims included Rajaram's mother-in-law, Indra Ramasesham, 69, and his 19-year-old son Krishna Rajaram, a Fulbright Scholar and honor student at UCLA. Also dead were Rajaram's wife, 39, Subasari Rajaram, and their two other sons, 12 and 7. Some of the victims had been shot more than once, and their identities were not immediately confirmed, he said. \"Due to the nature of their injuries, it's been a little difficult,\" Winter said, adding that there were no signs of a struggle. Police first found the mother-in-law shot in her bed in a downstairs bedroom, Moore said. Upstairs, the couple's eldest son was shot in the master bedroom; the wife in another bedroom with a gunshot wound to the head; the two younger sons in the bedroom they shared, both shot in the head. The 12-year-old was on the floor and the 7-year-old in bed, Moore said. The suspect was also in that bedroom, a gun still in his hand.

Others are expected to be seen in coming decades.\n\nThere are two ways to look at this: Either stay home (which might be less depressing and won't add more airline emissions) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just can't miss.\n\nFor those who want to head out, CNN got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from Bob Henson, author of \"The Rough Guide to Climate Change\" and a writer at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nHere are Henson's top five choices:\n\nGreat Barrier Reef, Australia\n\nWarming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs, which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays.\n\nMany of the world's reefs already are experiencing \"bleaching\" in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of Australia -- is seeing limited bleaching now, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority expects the problem to grow in coming decades.\n\nHenson said the reefs' colorful displays are not to be missed.\n\n\"It's a feast for the eyes in terms of color, texture variations -- it's just amazing to see,\" he said. \"It's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life.\"\n\nBoats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from Cairns, Queensland. If you go, tread lightly, Henson said. Visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close.\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nHow much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation. If huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of Greenland and the western shelf of Antarctica -- melt, then the rise is expected to be more dramatic.\n\n\"Nobody knows whether they're going to completely melt or not, but we do know it's not going to happen in the next 10 years,\" Henson said.\n\nBut for cities near the coast such as New Orleans, which already sits below sea level, rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike, even in the relative near term.\n\n\"In the next several hundred years, life there may be difficult, and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay,\" he said.\n\nHenson doesn't expect New Orleans to be underwater anytime soon. But travel to the Louisiana city may become more difficult in the future, he said. Scientists expect floods to become more frequent.\n\n\"It's sobering to be in New Orleans and look up at the levees that sit above you and keep out the Mississippi River,\" he said. \"You're standing below the level of the river, looking up.\"\n\nRocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado\n\nThe forests are experiencing significant changes due to varied environmental factors, as noted by Kyle Patterson, spokeswoman for the Rocky Mountain National Park. The issue is particularly visible at Patterson's park, northwest of Denver. Henson recommends visiting the park this decade to ensure you can still see the dense forests in decent shape.

{"question": "What was the number killed in the bombing?", "context": "(CNN) -- The United States believes that some members of Pakistan's spy service provided support for the deadly bombing last month of India's Embassy in Afghanistan, a U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN Friday. The Indian Embassy in Kabul was badly damaged in the July 7 bombing. Pakistan strongly denied the allegation Friday, but Afghanistan and India have previously accused Pakistan of involvement in the attack which resulted in multiple casualties, including an Indian defense attache. The official told CNN the evidence was not strong enough to draw a firm conclusion but there is a \"strong suspicion\" the Taliban was behind the attack, and that some unspecified aid came from Pakistan's Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. The official would not say how the intelligence was gathered, but he said the evidence was presented to senior Pakistani officials by a top CIA official, Deputy Director Stephen Kappes. The New York Times, sourcing U.S. government officials, reported Friday that the United States intercepted communications between Pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack in Kabul. Pakistani Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said the report \"unfounded and malicious\" and an \"effort to malign the ISI,\" -- Pakistan's Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence. \"The ISI is a very disciplined organization, manned by military officials. It has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al Qaeda, the Taliban, and those linked to the attack on mainland America on 9/11,\" Abbas said. Abbas said \"despite our insistence, no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations.\" Afghanistan claims Pakistan informally supports militants operating from havens in Pakistan's lawless tribal regions near the porous 1,500-mile border the two countries share. Earlier this month, Afghan lawmakers directly accused Pakistan's ISI in connection with a string of attacks in Afghanistan. Among these were the Kabul strike and an assassination attempt on Afghan President Hamid Karzai at an April 27 military ceremony. A senior Afghan government official said the charges were based on phone intercepts of conversations of plotters in Kabul with ISI officers in Pakistan. A U.S. government official, who would not comment on the specifics of the New York Times story, said, \"We've long noted the troubling reports of a relationship between the ISI and the Taliban, and the incident at the Indian Embassy seems to fit the pattern of those reports.\" India has previously blamed militants from Pakistan for the July 7 car bombing at the embassy. Wajid Shamsul Hasan, Pakistan's high commissioner to Britain, and Hamid Gul, former head of the ISI, firmly denied the agency's involvement in the attack. Watch Pakistan deny the allegations » \"There seems to be a bit of sensationalism in this story,\" Hasan said. He said the government has regularly denied claims that ISI is involved with militants in Afghanistan and noted that Pakistan has been cooperating in the fight against terrorism. Gul said the claims are \"preposterous\" and \"totally false,\" and cautioned that the CIA has been proven to be wrong about intelligence in the past. The New York Times report also sourced the U.S. officials as saying \"there was new information showing that members of the Pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the American campaign against them, in some cases allowing militants to avoid American missile strikes in Pakistan's tribal areas.\" Pakistan and Afghanistan have a tumultuous past. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, religious schools in Pakistan helped train fighters who battled the Soviets. After the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule, Pakistan was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically. It dropped its support after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on Washington and New York. Pakistan also has a troubled history with India, and in the past India has accused the ISI of supporting militant separatists in Indian-administered Kashmir, which has been the root of two wars between them.", "qID": "9a5df0f6413c4e8e91fed29d8279c438"}

{"question": "What is the high tide forecast?", "context": "Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The central business district of Bangkok dodged severe flooding Saturday afternoon, but surrounding areas of the bustling capital faced further inundation at the next high tide. A dreaded tide on Saturday spurred residents' fears that it would overwhelm defenses along the Chao Phraya River and its many canals. Bangkok's outer suburbs were already submerged, but the central city has been largely spared the misery Thailand has been suffering for months in the nation's worst flooding since 1942. In the east and the north of the city, water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods. But the city -- which sits barely above sea level -- still faces two converging threats. Massive runoff was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok, as high tides pushed the water in the opposite direction. \"The challenge is to manage the huge runoff from the north passing via the city on its way to the Gulf of Thailand,\" a Red Cross bulletin said. Bangkok's Chinatown area -- normally hopping with activity on a Saturday afternoon -- was largely desolate, with few passers-by wading in knee-deep water. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered work crews Friday to cut channels in roadways to allow faster drainage, according to the MCOT news agency. But the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps, the Bangkok Post reported. Health concerns were rising with the water. Bangkok residents plodded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within, the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials. The government sent out crocodile hunters after reports of crocodiles and snakes in the filthy floodwater. \"We were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters, and every day we see children playing in the water, bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground,\" said Annie Bodmer-Roy, spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Save the Children. As floodwater entered homes, some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave. Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was going to stay with relatives outside the city. \"Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded,\" said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it also was flooded. \"The water level is 2 meters (six feet) high and smells very bad,\" she said. The Bangkok Post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on Saturday and take them out of Bangkok. As of Saturday, an estimated 1 million of the city's 12 million residents had left. Another Bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house, which has been flooded for five days, and would not leave. Panic buying has led to a shortage of food and bottled water in the capital, residents said. And the worst might not yet be over. Officials urged tourists to steer clear of Bangkok, while noting that many of the other tourist spots, such as Phuket, remained dry and open for business. Thailand's Ministry of Public Health had transferred 280 of the capital's 520 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals upcountry, the MCOT news agency reported. The remaining 240 patients will be taken to hospitals in other provinces by Sunday, it said, citing Permanent-Secretary for Health Paichit Varachit. Health Minister Witthaya Buranasiri said that, after months of flooding, 107,101 Thais have been diagnosed with stress, 6,214 with depression and 878 at risk of suicide. In all, 1,356 people were under observation by health officials, the minister said, according to MCOT. The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert on Thursday, recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas. It noted that most tourist destinations, such as Phuket and Chiang Mai, were unaffected.

{"question": "What is happening in Chad?", "context": "ABECHE, Chad (CNN) -- Most of the 103 children that a French charity attempted to take to France from Chad for adoption are neither Sudanese nor orphans, three international aid agencies reported on Thursday. Six members of Zoe's Ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France, where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in. Three French journalists, a seven-member Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested. Representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with Zoe's Ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission. Chadian President Idriss Deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed, his chief of staff, Mahamat Hissene, said Thursday. The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of Abeche, where the children were taken, to a judge in N'Djamena, the capital, Hissene said. The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports. The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF said most of the children were living with their families before Zoe's Ark took them. The charity said the children were Sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation. The agencies said most of the children also probably come from Chadian villages along Chad's border with Sudan. The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities. Chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities. Chad's interior minister said Zoe's Ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help. The charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted. The Spaniards and Belgian are charged with complicity. The Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive said Thursday. \"We thought we were doing a humanitarian transport,\" said Antoni Cajal, sales director of Spain's Gir Jet charter firm. \"If an NGO [nongovernmental organization] has done something wrong, it's impossible for us to know.\" Spain's Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to Chad to try to win the group's release. Over the weekend, the captain appealed urgently to be rescued, fearing the crew could be harmed or killed, Cajal said. But the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, Cajal said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them. The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, Cajal said. On its Web site, Zoe's Ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of physicians, nurses, firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf. The Red Cross, UNHCR and UNICEF said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy. The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds. \"So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from Chadian villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border,\" the agencies said. \"Ninety-one children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent,\" the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing.", "qID": "c867c284d21e46119e6538baa179a82c"}

U.S. Marines fire 120mm mortars on Taliban positions on April 3 in Now Zad in Helmand province, Afghanistan. The incident occurred south of Kabul in the eastern Afghan province of Logar, when Afghan security forces and ISAF troops were conducting an operation. It comes as NATO members meet in Europe to discuss the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and as human rights groups this week urged NATO and the U.S. military to avoid civilian casualties and develop a well-coordinated condolence payment system for civilians victimized in the war. Troops saw a large group of insurgents placing a roadside bomb. The militants retreated to a compound and attacked ISAF troops with small arms. Troops surrounded the compound and urged them to surrender peacefully after it was cordoned off. It also asked the people in the compound to release women and children but no civilians left. Troops assaulted the compound and 12 male insurgents were killed in gunfire. An investigation is being conducted by Afghan National Security Forces at the site. Eight AK47 rifles, two rocket propelled grenade launchers, several rocket canisters, 82mm mortars, and two heavy machine guns were found in the compound. \"ANSF and ISAF are making significant progress against insurgent groups in Logar province who are involved in murdering civilians with IEDs,\" said Brig. Gen. Richard Blanchette, ISAF spokesman. \"Today's firefight illustrates the difference between ISAF troops who risk their lives to protect civilians, and insurgents who deliberately and tragically place civilians at risk.\" Also, ISAF reported the death of a soldier from the NATO-led force Friday in eastern Afghanistan.

{"question": "Who says border has never been more protected?", "context": "San Diego, California (CNN) -- Don't be surprised if, any day now, you read that the People's Republic of Arizona is in the market for nuclear warheads to put an end, once and for all, to illegal immigration on its southern border. After all, it's the next logical step for the rogue state.\n\nThis week, to advance the narrative that Arizona has no choice but to do its own immigration enforcement because the federal government is asleep at the switch, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called for air support. Brewer requested helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles from the White House to patrol the border region with Mexico.\n\nIn a letter to President Obama, Brewer asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the 'border states' to prevent illegal immigration. The governor also requested the deployment of unmanned drones, including possibly the Predator drones used in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, in her letter, Brewer even mentioned those foreign wars as examples of where the drones have been effective.\n\nWhat's the matter with Arizona? Isn't it a little early in the year for the folks in the desert to be suffering from sunstroke?\n\nI guess this is par for the course. Brewer just signed SB 1070, a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial-profiling law, to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent. Why shouldn't she get the chance to suit up and play general?\n\nAfter all, like the United States, Arizona is currently involved in two wars. There's the hypocritical war against the very illegal immigrants that the state has spent the past 15 years providing with gainful employment by allowing them to do jobs that Arizonans wouldn't do. And then there's the rhetorical war with the Obama administration, which Arizona wants to portray as negligent in stopping illegal immigration, which forced Arizonans to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThe argument that the federal government isn't actively engaged in border enforcement is both dishonest and reckless.\n\nIt is dishonest because it's not true. I've visited the U.S.-Mexico border a dozen times in the past 10 years: in Texas, Arizona and California. I've interviewed countless border patrol agents and supervisors. I've also been up in a Border Patrol helicopter flying above the border, which offers a unique perspective on border security.\n\nSo I can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you: The U.S.-Mexico border has never been more fortified. There are now more than 20,000 border patrol agents on the federal payroll. That's more agents than any other federal enforcement agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those agents apprehend people and deport them at a feverish clip. In fact, it was recently announced that the Obama administration deported more people last year than the Bush administration during its final year in office.\n\nIt is reckless because -- when this law is hauled before a federal judge, as it will be -- opponents will argue that the measure violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by usurping federal authority to enforce immigration law.

{"question": "will the glaciers melt", "context": "(CNN) -- Scientists expect some great travel spots to be altered or ruined by global climate change. Some of the changes are already taking place. Others are expected to be seen in coming decades. There are two ways to look at this: Either stay home (which might be less depressing and won't add more airline emissions) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just can't miss. For those who want to head out, CNN got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from Bob Henson, author of \"The Rough Guide to Climate Change\" and a writer at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Here are Henson's top five choices: Great Barrier Reef, Australia Warming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs, which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays. Many of the world's reefs already are experiencing \"bleaching\" in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons. The Great Barrier Reef -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of Australia -- is seeing limited bleaching now, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority expects the problem to grow in coming decades. Henson said the reefs' colorful displays are not to be missed. \"It's a feast for the eyes in terms of color, texture variations -- it's just amazing to see,\" he said. \"It's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life.\" Boats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from Cairns, Queensland. If you go, tread lightly, Henson said. Visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close. New Orleans, Louisiana How much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation. If huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of Greenland and the western shelf of Antarctica -- melt, then the rise is expected to be more dramatic. \"Nobody knows whether they're going to completely melt or not, but we do know it's not going to happen in the next 10 years,\" Henson said. But for cities near the coast such as New Orleans, which already sits below sea level, rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike, even in the relative near term. \"In the next several hundred years, life there may be difficult, and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay,\" he said. Henson doesn't expect New Orleans to be underwater anytime soon. But travel to the Louisiana city may become more difficult in the future, he said. Scientists expect floods to become more frequent. \"It's sobering to be in New Orleans and look up at the levees that sit above you and keep out the Mississippi River,\" he said. \"You're standing below the level of the river, looking up.\" Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado Herds of tiny pine beetles are munching away at Colorado's forests, turning the evergreens a sickly red and destroying large patches of trees. Cold snaps -- which, in mountain terms, mean about five nights of minus-30 temperatures -- usually kill off the native beetles. But winters are warming, and Henson and others said they worry the beetles can't be stopped. The beetle infestation \"has reached epidemic proportions as a result of climate issues,\" said Kyle Patterson, spokeswoman for the Rocky Mountain National Park. The beetles are causing problems all over America's mountainous west, but the issue is particularly visible at Patterson's park, northwest of Denver. Henson recommends visiting the park this decade to ensure you can still see the dense forests in decent shape. Some of the reddened forests look beautiful in a strange way, Henson said, but visitors should note", "qID": "d3d3a6d45102452993e2ad22b6e261d3"}

{"question": "How many bodies have been found so far?", "context": "Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Air traffic controllers in Lebanon were telling the pilot of an Ethiopian Airlines flight to change course shortly before it crashed into the sea, the country's transportation minister told CNN Tuesday. An international search team was combing Lebanon's Mediterranean coastline for signs of life Tuesday amid fears that all 90 people aboard the Addis Ababa-bound airliner perished in the accident, authorities said. Lebanese Transportation Minister Ghazi al-Aridi said Tuesday it was too early to determine whether pilot error had caused the crash. He said the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders would need to be recovered to determine why Flight 409 disappeared from radar screens shortly after taking off from Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport at about 2:30 a.m. local time. The control tower lost contact with the plane before it made a course correction Monday, al-Aridi said. In a statement, Ethiopian Airlines said the pilot of the flight had more than 20 years of experience flying various aircraft with the airline's network. The plane had been declared safe and fit to fly following a regular maintenance service on December 25, 2009, the airline said. The search included aircraft from the United States, Britain, France and Cyprus. The U.S. military sent the USS Ramage -- a guided missile destroyer -- and Navy P-3 aircraft in response to Lebanese requests for assistance, according to U.S. defense officials. 'We don't believe that there is any indication for sabotage or foul play,' Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said Monday. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is also sending an investigator because the plane was made by a U.S. manufacturer. The Boeing 737-800 had eight crew members and 82 passengers -- 51 Lebanese nationals, 23 Ethiopians, two Britons and citizens from Canada, Iraq, Russia, Syria, Turkey and France -- when it went down, the airline said. The plane crashed about 3.5 kilometers (2 miles) west of the town of Na'ameh which is 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Beirut. Government-owned Ethiopian Airlines is one of the largest carriers in Africa, serving Europe and three other continents. The airline has experienced two fatal crashes since 1980. In November 1996, a flight bound for Ivory Coast was hijacked by three men who demanded that the pilot fly to Australia. The pilot crashed while attempting an emergency landing near the Comoros Islands off Africa. About 130 of the 172 people aboard died, according to published reports. And in September 1988, a flight struck a flock of birds during takeoff. During the crash landing that followed, 31 of the 105 people aboard died.

Stanley McChrystal, wants 40,000 more pairs of boots on the ground.\n\nInitial reports about the cables sent by Eikenberry appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times. All three newspapers attributed the reports to senior U.S. officials, without identifying them. Two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN that Eikenberry sent two cables to Washington expressing reservations about troop increases amid uncertainty over President Hamid Karzai's government.\n\nNeither Eikenberry nor the White House would comment on the contents of private advice between the envoy and the president, but the reports alarmed Karzai enough that his office sought confirmation from the U.S. Embassy about them, a Karzai spokesman told CNN.\n\nKarzai's office did not get the information it sought, the spokesman said.\n\nWhatever Eikenberry told the president, the ambassador is unusually well versed in the military problems facing Afghanistan.\n\nHe retired from the Army after nearly 40 years of service with the rank of lieutenant general on April 28 -- one day before he was sworn in as ambassador, according to his State Department biography.\n\nHis long military career included time in Kabul as U.S. security coordinator and chief of the Office of Military Cooperation.\n\n\"Afghanistan has been at the center of my career since 9/11, when the terrorist-commandeered aircraft crashed into the Pentagon just below the office in which I was working,\" Eikenberry said at his Senate confirmation hearing in March.\n\n\"There is no silver bullet and no quick, cheap or easy solutions.

{"question": "At what age is autism a huge risk?", "context": "(CNN) -- A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics indicates an increase in the identification of autism or related disorders over previous estimates.\n\nChildren at the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta, Georgia, receive instruction.\n\n\"This is a significant issue that needs immediate attention,\" Dr. Ileana Arias, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. \"A concerted effort and substantial national response is warranted.\"\n\nThe study utilized data from the federal government's 2007 national survey of children's health. The survey was conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration, and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe results are based on a national telephone survey of more than 78,000 parents.\niReport.com: How has autism affected your family?\n\nIn the study, parents were asked whether a health care provider had ever told them their child had an autism spectrum disorder. ASD is a group of brain disorders comprising autism and two less severe disorders: Asperger's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.\n\nChildren with the disorder show impairment in social interaction and in their ability to communicate. They often display repetitive behavior. Watch families discuss autism »\n\nThe investigators also asked a follow-up question: Were the children considered to have ASD now? Nearly 40 percent of the parents and guardians said no.\n\nThat finding led the authors to question whether some of the children originally diagnosed as having ASD may have been improperly diagnosed, since the disorders are not considered curable.\n\nBut Kogan said the two surveys cannot be compared because the earlier investigators did not ask the follow-up question about whether the children were still considered to have the disorder.\n\nStill, based on the findings, lead author Dr. Michael D. Kogan of HRSA's maternal and child health bureau estimated the prevalence of ASD among children.\n\nBoys were four times as likely as girls to have ASD, and non-Hispanic black and multiracial children were less likely than non-Hispanic white children.\n\nHe estimated that 673,000 children have ASD in the United States.\n\nMonday's findings indicate an increase from the average that was reported in 2003, the researchers said.\n\nThe researchers urged caution in interpreting the change, noting that an increase in diagnoses does not necessarily mean that more children have the disorder. It could simply reflect a heightened awareness of the disorder.\n\n\"We don't know whether the change in the number over time is a result of the change in the actual condition, in the actual number of conditions or in part due to the fact that the condition is being recognized differently,\" Arias said.\n\nShe said that preliminary results from a separate, CDC-funded study she is working on also indicate that a certain percentage of children in the United States are affected by ASD. That study is to be published later this year, she said.\n\n\"This is a behavioral diagnosis, and it's difficult to make, and it's difficult to make at young ages,\" said Dr. Peter van Dyck, HRSA's associate administrator for maternal and child health.\n\nHalf of the cases were considered mild by their parents, the study reported.\n\nThe results underscore the importance of creating policies that will result in early identification and intervention, the officials said.\n\nThe reports raise \"a lot of questions about how we are preparing in terms of housing, employment, social support -- all the issues that many of these people are going to need,\" said Dr. Tom Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\n\"It also raises questions about how well we're prepared in the educational system to provide for the special needs of many of these kids.\"\n\nInsel said the federal government is beefing up the resources it is mobilizing to address autism and related disorders, with $85 million being appropriated by the National Institutes of Health and $48", "qID": "e4864c159e354a4cbc7b2e4fdfd2c4a2"}
{"question": "what health problems suffered McMahon?", "context": "(CNN) -- Ed McMahon, the longtime pitchman and Johnny Carson sidekick whose \"Heeeeeeerre's Johnny!\" became a part of the vernacular, has died. Ed McMahon had suffered several health problems in recent years. McMahon passed away peacefully shortly after midnight at the Ronald Reagan/UCLA Medical Center, his publicist, Howard Bragman, said Tuesday. McMahon, 86, was hospitalized in February with a serious illness. He had suffered a number of health problems in recent years, including a neck injury caused by a 2007 fall. In 2002, he sued various insurance companies and contractors over mold in his house and later collected a $7 million settlement. Though he later hosted a variety of shows -- including \"Star Search\" and \"TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes,\" McMahon's biggest fame came alongside Carson on \"The Tonight Show,\" which Carson hosted from 1962 to 1992. The two met not long after Carson began hosting the game show \"Who Do You Trust?\" in 1957. iReport.com: Share your memories of Ed McMahon. \"Johnny didn't look as if he was dying to see me,\" McMahon, who was hosting a show on a Philadelphia TV station, told People magazine in 1980 about the pair's first meeting. \"He was standing with his back to the door, staring at a couple of workmen putting letters on a theater marquee. I walked over and stood beside him. Finally the two guys finished, and Johnny asked, 'What have you been doing?' I told him. He said, 'Good to meet you, Ed,' shook my hand, and I was out of the office. The whole meeting was about as exciting as watching a traffic light change.\" Though McMahon was surprised to be offered the job as Carson's sidekick, the two soon proved to have a strong chemistry. Carson was, by nature, introverted and dry-witted; McMahon was the boisterous and outgoing second banana, content to give Carson straight lines or laugh uproariously at his jokes (a characteristic much-parodied by comedians). Carson made cracks about McMahon's weight, his drinking and the men's trouble with divorce. McMahon was married three times; Carson, who died in 2005, had four wives. McMahon was also the show's designated pitchman, a talent he honed to perfection during \"Tonight's\" 30-year run with Carson, even if sometimes the in-show commercial spots fell flat. For one of the show's regular sponsors, Alpo dog food, McMahon usually extolled the virtues of the product while a dog eagerly gobbled down a bowl. But one day the show's regular dog wasn't available, and the substitute pooch wasn't very hungry. McMahon recalled the incident in his 1998 memoir, \"For Laughing Out Loud.\" \"Then I saw Johnny come into my little commercial area. He got down on his hands and knees and came over to me. ... I started to pet Johnny. Nice boss, I was thinking as I pet him on the head, nice boss. By this point the audience was hysterical. ... I just kept going. I was going to get my commercial done. \" 'The next time you're looking at the canned dog food ...' -- he rubbed his cheek against my leg --  ... reach for the can that contains real beef.' Johnny got up on his knees and started begging for more. I started petting him again ... and then he licked my hand.\" McMahon also promoted Budweiser, American Family Insurance and -- during the most recent Super Bowl -- Cash4Gold.com. Entertainment Weekly named him No. 1 on its list of TV's greatest sidekicks. Edward Leo Peter McMahon Jr. was born in Detroit, Michigan, on March 6, 1923.

The version of the Magna Carta up for auction has been on display at the National Archives in Washington. Sotheby's will auction off one of the earliest versions of the Magna Carta later this year, the auction house announced Tuesday. This will be the first time any version of the Magna Carta has ever gone up for auction, according to David Redden, vice chairman of Sotheby's. The Magna Carta is expected to fetch at least $20 million to $30 million, Redden said. Redden, who has also sold dinosaur bones, space race artifacts and a first printing of the Declaration of Independence, called the Magna Carta \"the most important document on earth.\" The charter mandated the English king to cede certain basic rights to his citizens, ensuring that no man is above the law. Many believe the Magna Carta was the first document to recognize the legal right to freedom from tyranny, an influential concept to American political philosophers -- from the founding fathers to the modern presidency. The version to be auctioned is one of fewer than 20 known copies of the Magna Carta, which means \"Great Charter\" in Latin. The document was first devised in 1215, but not confirmed into English law until 1297 -- the year this version was issued and sealed by King Edward I. The document is one of only two copies of the charter that exist outside of England, according to Sotheby's. This Magna Carta and another version in Australia are the only two ever to have been privately sold.

{"question": "What causes people to hire illegals?", "context": "San Diego, California (CNN) -- Don't be surprised if, any day now, you read that the People's Republic of Arizona is in the market for nuclear warheads to put an end, once and for all, to illegal immigration on its southern border. After all, it's the next logical step for the rogue state.\n\n\nThis week, to advance the narrative that Arizona has no choice but to do its own immigration enforcement because the federal government is asleep at the switch, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called for air support. Brewer requested helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles from the White House to patrol the border region with Mexico.\n\nIn a letter to President Obama, Brewer asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the \"border states\" to prevent illegal immigration. The governor also requested the deployment of unmanned drones, including possibly the Predator drones used in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, in her letter, Brewer even mentioned those foreign wars as examples of where the drones have been effective.\n\nWhat's the matter with Arizona? Isn't it a little early in the year for the folks in the desert to be suffering from sunstroke?\n\nI guess this is par for the course. Brewer just signed SB 1070, a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial-profiling law, to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent. Why shouldn't she get the chance to suit up and play general?\n\nAfter all, like the United States, Arizona is currently involved in two wars. There's the hypocritical war against illegal immigrants and the rhetorical war with the Obama administration, which Arizona wants to portray as negligent in stopping illegal immigration, which forced Arizonans to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThe argument that the federal government isn't actively engaged in border enforcement is both dishonest and reckless.\n\nIt is dishonest because it's not true. I've visited the U.S.-Mexico border a dozen times in the past 10 years: in Texas, Arizona and California. I've interviewed countless border patrol agents and supervisors. I've also been up in a Border Patrol helicopter flying above the border, which offers a unique perspective on border security.\n\nSo I can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you: The U.S.-Mexico border has never been more fortified. There are now more than 20,000 border patrol agents on the federal payroll. That's more agents than any other federal enforcement agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those agents apprehend people and deport them at a feverish clip. In fact, it was recently announced that the Obama administration deported more people last year than the Bush administration during its final year in office.\n\nIt is reckless because -- when this law is hauled before a federal judge, as it will be -- opponents will argue that the measure violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by usurping federal authority to enforce immigration law. And that's the very thing that proponents seem to be admitting in their bravado. In fact, it might not be a bad idea for Arizona officials to pipe down and stop bragging about how they're doing the job of the federal government in terms of immigration enforcement, since that's a no-no under the Constitution.\n\nIf the federal government does take border enforcement seriously, critics might ask: Why are there still people trying to enter the United States illegally? Simple. We can dig a moat, deploy an army, build walls or call in an airstrike, but desperate people will always find a way to go around, under or over any impediment in their path to a better life.\n\nThis isn't to condone illegal immigration. My views -- in support of deportations, workplace raids, giving more resources to the Border Patrol etc. -- are well known. I'm just telling you what Border Patrol agents tell me: that it doesn't make any sense to focus all our attention", "qID": "f2d500e47e4d4a18bd068db4ff12063c"}
{"question": "What is Sotomayor's age?", "context": "(CNN) -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor knew she wanted to go into law from an early age. Sonia Sotomayor says the nomination is the \"most humbling honor\" of her life. As a child, she aspired to be like Nancy Drew, the detective in the popular children's mystery series. But at the age of 8, she was diagnosed with diabetes and told she would not be able to pursue that line of work. Sotomayor said it was another fictional character that inspired her next choice. \"I noticed that [defense attorney] Perry Mason was involved in a lot of the same kinds of investigative work that I had been fascinated with reading Nancy Drew, so I decided to become a lawyer,\" Sotomayor told the American Bar Association publication in 2000. \"Once I focused on becoming a lawyer, I never deviated from that goal.\" See Sotomayor's life in photos » Sotomayor's parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during World War II. Her father worked in a factory and didn't speak English. She was born in the Bronx and grew up in a public housing project, not too far from the stadium of her favorite team -- the New York Yankees. Her father died when she was 9, leaving her mother to raise her and her younger brother on her own. Related: Sotomayor well known in sports Her mother, whom Sotomayor describes as her biggest inspiration, worked six days a week to care for her and her younger brother, and instilled in them the value of an education. Background on Sotomayor » Sotomayor later graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and went on to attend Yale law school, where she was editor of the Yale Law Journal. In her three-decade career, she has worked at nearly every level of the judicial system, and on Tuesday she became President Obama's pick to replace retiring Justice David Souter on the Supreme Court. Watch Sotomayor accept the nomination » Sotomayor thanked Obama for \"the most humbling honor of my life.\" \"I hope that as the Senate and American people learn more about me, they will see that I am an ordinary person who has been blessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences. Today is one of those experiences,\" she said. Sotomayor is touted by supporters as a justice with bipartisan favor and historic appeal. She currently serves as a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The liberal-leaning justice was named a district judge by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and was elevated to her current seat by President Clinton. Supporters say her appointment history, along with what they describe as her moderate-liberal views, will give her some bipartisan backing in the Senate. Sotomayor presided over about 450 cases while on the district court. Prior to her judicial appointments, Sotomayor was a partner at a private law firm and spent time as an assistant district attorney prosecuting violent crimes. Robin Kar, who clerked for Sotomayor from 1998 to 1999, described her as a \"warm, extraordinarily kind and caring person.\" Watch Kar recall his work with Sotomayor » \"She has an amazing story, but she's also just an amazing person,\" he said, adding that she has a knack for getting to know those around her. \"She was the judge who, in the courthouse for example, knew all of the doormen, knew the cafeteria workers, who knew the janitors -- she didn't just know all of the other judges and the politicians. She really went out of her way to get to know everyone and was well loved by everyone.\" Conservatives argue Sotomayor has a \"hard-left record\" and believes that judges should consider experiences of women and minorities in their decision-making.

[PAR] This player looks like he needed a mulligan. John Cumming/Photodisc/Getty Images [PAR] By Brent Kelley [PAR] Updated February 05, 2016. [PAR] A mulligan, most simply put, is a 'do-over' in various sports. Made a mistake? Take a mulligan and redo that action. The first attempt is not counted. [PAR] Are Mulligans 'Legal'? [PAR] No. There is never a time, when playing under the general rules of sports, that a mulligan is 'legal.' Mulligans are not allowed under the official rules. [PAR] But Mulligans Are Very Popular [PAR] But just because mulligans aren't 'legal' doesn't mean their use isn't common and popular among recreational players. Many amateurs and recreational players - individuals just out to have a fun game with friends, as opposed to serious players looking for competition - are lax in observing the rules anyway. [PAR] So mulligans are most often employed during friendly games by friends; or during charity or playday tournaments where mulligans are sometimes sold. If mulligans are for sale at a charity tournament, that means the player can buy, say, three mulligans for a set price each. [PAR] continue reading below our video [PAR] What Are Mulligans? [PAR] The sale of mulligans is sometimes used as an additional fund-raiser at charitable events. [PAR] Common Ways of Using Mulligans [PAR] Do all players use mulligans in the same way? No - whatever a group of players agrees upon is what counts (unless you are using mulligans in something like a charity tournament or association outing setting - then do what the organizers tell you). [PAR] How many mulligans you get to use during a game, what types of actions you can use them for, and so on, are things that differ from player to player. So if you're playing with a new group and mulligans are in effect, you need to clarify what is allowed. [PAR] Here are some common ways that mulligans are used: [PAR] Some players limit the use of mulligans to the first play only, or to the first and tenth plays only. [PAR] Some players use one mulligan per half, but anywhere during each half. [PAR] It's most common for mulligans to be used only off the start, i.e., you can only use a mulligan to redo a start. However, some groups allow mulligans during the game, too. [PAR] Less common is allowing mulligans during critical moments or out of challenging situations, but some players even do that. [PAR] It is rarer still - rarely seen, in fact - for mulligans to be used during scoring moments. [PAR] And some groups allow mulligans from just about anywhere during the game, but set a limit - say, three mulligans per game, or nine, or 18. [PAR] Clearly, there are many different ways that players use mulligans. If you have a regular group of friends you play with, and your group allows mulligans, you probably long ago settled into your own 'rules' about using them. [PAR] Note that mulligans are common in the United States, but rarely seen in the UK, for example. As with all localized sports customs, formats and betting games, when playing with players you don't know clear up the ground rules before play starts to avoid possible confusion later. [PAR] And again, please note: If you are playing in a tournament, handicap round or other setting in which the official rules of sports are strictly followed, you cannot play mulligans. [PAR] Why Is It Called a 'Mulligan'? [PAR] Good question! And the fact is, nobody knows for sure how a do-over in sports came to be called a mulligan.

{"question": "In 1216, English monarch King John was said to have lost the crown jewels while crossing which body of water?", "context": "[DOC] [TLE] King John's Lost Treasure | Lost Treasure - Crystal Wind™King John's Lost Treasure | Lost Treasure [PAR] King John's Lost Treasure [PAR] Category: Lost Treasure Hits: 998 [PAR] John, King of England from 1199–1216, is remembered today for many reasons, most of them unfavourable. To children he is best known as the arch-villain in the Robin Hood story, and in history he is remembered as ‘bad king John’, who lost most of the overseas possessions of the Angevin empire, irritated the barons so much that he was forced to sign the Magna Carta in 1215. The legend of John’s lost treasure has been handed down and grown in the telling for 700 years, largely by word of mouth, and anyone brought up in the Fens has heard it from an early age. [PAR] John was born on Christmas Eve, the youngest son of Henry II and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine. As a child, John tended to be overshadowed by his older brother Richard. Like his father, John developed a reputation for violent rages which lead to him foaming at the mouth. Henry left no land to John when he died so John was given the nick-name John Lackland. [PAR] In 1189, all of Henry's territory went to his oldest son, Richard I, better known as Richard the Lionheart. In 1199, Richard was killed in France and John became the king of England. His reign started in an unfortunate way. In 1202, John's nephew, Arthur of Brittany, was murdered. Many in Brittany believed that John was responsible for his murder and they rebelled against John. [PAR] In 1204, John's army was defeated in Brittany and John had no choice but to retreat. His military standing among the nobles fell and he was given a new nickname - John Softsword. The defeat in north France was a major blow for John and a costly one. To pay for the defeat, John increased taxes which was not popular with anybody other than John and his treasurers. John also succeeded in falling out with the pope in 1207. John quarreled with the pope over who should be Archbishop of Canterbury. The pope excommunicated John and put England under a Medieval Church law that stated that no christening or marriage would be legal until the time the pope said that they would be. Medieval Church law said that only christened people could get to Heaven while children born out of marriage were doomed to Hell. This placed people in England under a terrible strain and they blamed one person for this - John. [PAR] In 1213, John had to give in and surrender the spiritual well-being of the whole country to the pope. However, the pope never fully trusted John and in 1214, the pope proclaimed that anybody who tried to overthrow John would be legally entitled to do so. In the same year, John lost another battle to the French at Bouvines. This defeat resulted in England losing all her possessions in France. This was too much for the powerful barons in England. In 1214, they rebelled. John was forced to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede in 1215. This guaranteed the people of England rights that the king could not go back on. In 1216, John tried to go back but this only provoked the barons into declaring war on him. By 1216, John was ill. During the war, he suffered from dysentery. [PAR] The basic story of his lost treasures, as related by historians from the 13th century onwards, is that King John was travelling in the East of England in late 1216. By the autumn of 1216, John’s fortunes had sunk to a new low. He had inherited the mighty Angevin empire in England and France forged by his father Henry II, pawned to pay for the crusades by his brother Richard – and squandered by himself. Having already lost his lands in Normandy to the French king, he had faced a rampaging French army on his own soil aided and abetted by his own rebellious barons. The previous year he had been forced by them to sign the Magna Carta, reducing the powers of the crown. Although", "qID": "1bb1ec2c1da444b6a4f4e31f8b9affb3"}
{"question": "Which Roxy Music hit single features Robert E Lee?", "context": "The Story Behind The Song: Virginia Plain By Roxy Music - Classic Rock. Features / 28 Apr 2014 / by Mick Wall. Roxy's glam-era debut broke all the rules: no chorus, a fade intro and a stop-dead ending. So just what was Bryan Ferry's exercise in coolly-aloof style all about? It was the song that gave Roxy Music their big breakthrough, and the summer of 1972 one of its defining chart moments. Yet it was a hit single that didn’t so much ignore the rules as simply get them arse-backwards: no chorus, a faded-in intro and a sudden ending – the opposite of ‘normal’ singles. The song’s title wasn’t even mentioned until the final, dead-stop moment, when singer Bryan Ferry suddenly blurts: ‘What’s her name? Virginia Plain!’ “This day and age when you think of singles, they have the formula perfected,” says Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera. “Straight into the chorus for the beginning, play the hook, quick verse, back to chorus, repeat until fade. There was none of that with Virginia Plain.” A guileful subversion of existing tastes? An arrogant art-rock mission statement, signalling the arrival of a new way of being? “No, none of that,” Manzanera insists. “We just hadn’t a clue how to make a single. We’d never done one before.” In typically back-to-front fashion, Roxy had released their debut album two months earlier, in June 1972. Ripe with songs that had no chorus or didn’t even reference their titles, and often stopped without warning, it nonetheless managed to clip the edge of the Top 10. Recording and releasing their very first single in August 1972 was almost an afterthought. “We were told: ‘The album’s done reasonably well. You should do a single,’” says Manzanera. “We all sort of went, ‘Oh, all right...’” When the band entered London’s Command Studios in July, they hadn’t even rehearsed the song. “We just turned up at the studio, Bryan played us these three incredibly simple chords on the piano, and we just started messing around with it there and then,” says Manzanera. ‘We’ was the classic early Roxy line-up, also featuring sax and oboe player Andy Mackay, drummer Paul Thompson and the cryptically-named Eno (no one yet knew his first name was Brian) on VCS3 synthesizer and ‘treatments’, whatever they were. The messing around proved to be extensive. As well as the stream-of-consciousness joie de vivre of the lyrics (‘Flavours of the mountain streamline, midnight-blue casino floors/Dance the cha-cha thru till sunrise, opens up exclusive doors, oh wow!’), there were unique sounds: Ferry’s vibrato-heavy voice; the sound of a motorbike roaring off into the distance; Eno’s Tonka-toy synths; most absurd and beautiful of all, a parping oboe. “Was there ever a hit single with an oboe in it?” muses Manzanera. “I don’t know. But I think the feeling was there should be. No other band at the time seemed to have one.” But then Virginia Plain had a lot of things going for it that other bands could barely dream of – not least the sense that someone, somewhere, was having a giant laugh at the rest of the world’s expense. “There were certainly some odd things in it that you couldn’t hope for other people to get,” allows Manzanera. “For instance, the opening verse...", "qID": "87af8ae37be241b68cee5216ffaacfa4"}

Although the color of the seals and serial numbers on Gold Certificates was yellow, here orange is used for greater contrast.  The reverse of large note Gold Certificates had actually been orange, \"goldbacks\" as opposed to \"greenbacks\"; but small note Gold Certificates were made \"greenbacks\" also.  (That was reversed with series 1934 Gold Certificates, which again had orange reverses, but those notes never circulated to the public). [PAR] That was part of a process to unify the design of all the currency.  The variety of large note design gave way to common elements and a common look for the small notes.  This changed little over the years, until a radically redesigned $100 bill was introduced in the 1990's, inaugurating a gradual change in all the currency for security reasons.  United States currency had never featured anti-counterfeiting devices like watermarked paper and security threads, which had appeared in foreign money decades earlier.

When one series of $100,000 notes was issued (1934 Gold Certificates), Wilson was put on them.

Although biographical dictionaries accustomed to single occupations typically treat him as merely a cartographer or a geographer, Mercator distinguished himself at various times as a calligrapher, an engraver, a maker of scientific instruments, and a publisher. No less impressive are his deep interests in mathematics, astronomy, cosmography, terrestrial magnetism, history, philosophy, and theology. Although biographers lament the lack of diaries, account books, and carefully archived personal correspondence, the historical record reveals Mercator as an introspective and energetic chap who was competent in science, honest and well liked, technically savvy and clever with his hands, curious about the world around him, successful as an entrepreneur, and well positioned to make a pair of substantial contributions to mapmaking. [PAR] Mercator’s first biographer was Walter Ghim, his neighbor in Duisburg, the small German city where he lived from 1552 until his death in 1594. A twelve-term mayor of the town, Ghim contributed an essay to the 1595 edition of Mercator’s book of maps, published posthumously by his youngest son, Rumold. Ghim’s essay is more a long obituary than a critical biography. The mayor praises Mercator as a “remarkable and distinguished man,” notes his “mild character and honest way of life,” and provides dates and other details for key events in the cartographer’s career. Thus we learn that Gerard Mercator was born at approximately 6 a.m. on March 5, 1512, in Rupelmonde, Flanders, where his parents Hubert and Emerentiana were visiting Hubert’s brother, Gisbert Mercator, “the energetic priest of that city.” (Flanders is roughly coincident with the northern part of present-day Belgium, and as figure 3.1 shows, the village of Rupelmonde is about ten miles southwest of Antwerp.) He died “82 years, 37 weeks, and 6 hours” later—a remarkably long life for the sixteenth century—after coping in his final years with partial paralysis and a cerebral hemorrhage. Ghim offers a detailed description of Mercator’s failing health and last rites but says little about the mapmaker’s early life. [PAR] Places Mercator lived or visited (larger lettering), with present-day international boundaries and additional cities (smaller labels) as a frame of reference. [PAR] Scholarly interpretations of sixteenth-century Flanders helped historian of calligraphy Arthur Osley paint a richer picture. Although Mercator’s parents had little money—his father was a shoemaker and small farmer—Gisbert was at least better connected. Through his uncle’s influence, Gerard was enrolled at age fifteen in the distinguished monastic school at ’s-Hertogenbosch run by the Brethren of the Common Life, who accepted poor but bright boys willing to train for the priesthood. The brothers specialized in copying sacred texts, and their school excelled at teaching penmanship. In addition to learning Christian theology and Latin, Mercator developed a practical and lasting interest in the elegant italic script in which he engraved place names and interpretative text for his maps. He considered italic lettering more appropriate for scholarly writing than Gothic and other less formal (and often less legible) styles of handwriting, and in 1540 he published Literarum latinarum, quas Italicas cursoriasque vocant, scribendarum ratio (How to Write the Latin Letters Which They Call Italic or Cursive), a short manual that was influential in the adoption of italic lettering in cartography. [PAR] Various renderings of Mercator’s name invite confusion. Although his German father apparently went by Hubert Cremer, vernacular versions of the family name include de Cremer, Kramer, and Kremer. Krämer (the modern spelling) is the German word for merchant or shopkeeper, Cremer is its Dutch equivalent, and Mercator is the Latin version, which the future mapmaker adopted at ’s-Hertogenbosch.

The pleura lines the inner surface of the chest wall, covers the diaphragm, and is reflected over the structures occupying the middle of the thorax; this portion is termed the parietal pleura. The two layers are continuous with one another around and below the root of the thorax; in health they are in actual contact with one another, but the potential space between them is known as the pleural cavity. The right and left pleural sacs are entirely separate from one another; between them are all the thoracic viscera except the main thoracic organs, and they only touch each other for a short distance in front; opposite the second and third pieces of the sternum the interval between the two sacs is termed the mediastinum. [PAR] Different portions of the parietal pleura have received special names which indicate their position: thus, that portion which lines the inner surfaces of the ribs and Intercostales is the costal pleura; that clothing the convex surface of the diaphragm is the diaphragmatic pleura; that which rises into the neck, over the summit of the thoracic region, is the cupula of the pleura (cervical pleura); and that which is applied to the other thoracic viscera is the mediastinal pleura.

From the vertebral column the pleura passes to the side of the pericardium, which it covers to a slight extent; it then covers the back part of the thoracic region, and also over the sides of the thoracic region.

{"question": "Which metabolite activates AtxA?", "context": "Bacillus anthracis plasmid pXO1 carries the structural genes for the three anthrax toxin proteins, cya (edema factor), lef (lethal factor), and pag (protective antigen). Another pXO1 gene, atxA, encodes a transactivator of anthrax toxin synthesis. Here we show that transcription of atxA does not appear to differ in cells grown in 5% CO2 compared with cells grown in air. Using a new efficient method for gene replacement in B. anthracis, we constructed an atxA-null mutant in which the atxA-coding sequence on pXO1 is replaced with an omega km-2 cassette. Transcription of all three toxin genes is decreased in the absence of atxA. The pag gene possesses two apparent transcription start sites, P1 and P2; only transcripts with 5' ends mapping to P1 are decreased in the atxA-null mutant. Deletion analysis of the pag promoter region indicates that the 111 bp region upstream of the P1 site is sufficient for atxA-mediated activation of this transcript. The cya and lef genes each have one apparent start site for transcription. Transcripts with 5' ends mapping to these sites are not detected in the atxA-null mutant. The atxA-null mutant is avirulent in mice. Moreover, the antibody response to all three toxin proteins is decreased significantly in atxA-null mutant-infected mice. These data suggest that the atxA gene product also regulates toxin gene expression during infection.", "qID": "e37eef543acc42c0902146dfb8efe1c7"}
{"question": "Mutation of which gene is implicated in the Christianson syndrome?", "context": "Christianson syndrome in boys is characterized by profound mental retardation with autistic behavior, microcephaly, epilepsy, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. Progressive cerebellar atrophy with motor regression is a remarkable feature in some patients. We report on a 22-year-old male patient with Christianson syndrome carrying a novel mutation. The infantile phenotype suggested pervasive developmental disorder, then profound mental retardation ensued. In later childhood, progressive cerebellar atrophy was diagnosed on serial brain MRIs and motor regression occurred. Furthermore, ophthalmological evaluations showed a retinitis pigmentosum previously unreported in this condition. We conclude that the natural history of the disease in this patient tends to confirm the degenerative nature of Christianson syndrome, and that retinal degeneration may be part of the condition. Before the onset of degeneration, the syndromic association of severe mental retardation, autistic behavior, external ophthalmoplegia, and facial dysmorphism in male patients is a clue to the diagnosis.", "qID": "1c8d376fd6a5424aa7f69d6d2222e256"}
{"question": "Which polymerase transcribes pri-miRNAs?", "context": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21 nt RNAs that regulate many biological processes in plants by mediating translational inhibition or cleavage of target transcripts. Arabidopsis mutants defective in miRNA biogenesis have overlapping and highly pleiotropic phenotypes including serrated leaves and ABA hypersensitivity. Recent evidence indicates that pri-miRNA genes undergo transcription, but the specific enzyme involved is not detailed. Since transcripts are generally capped, we hypothesized that CBP (cap-binding protein) 20 and 80 may bind to capped primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts and play a role in their processing. Here, we show that cbp20 and cbp80 mutants have reduced miRNA levels and increased pri-miRNA levels. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that pri-miRNAs 159, 166, 168 and 172 could be associated with CBP20 and CBP80. We found that CBP20 and CBP80 are stabilized by ABA by a post-translational mechanism, and these proteins are needed for ABA induction of miR159 during seed germination. The lack of miR159 accumulation in ABA-treated seeds of cbp20/80 mutants leads to increased MYB33 and MYB101 transcript levels, and presumably higher levels of these positive regulators result in ABA hypersensitivity. Genetic and molecular analyses show that CBP20 and 80 have overlapping function in the same developmental pathway as SE and HYL1. Our results identify new components in miRNA biogenesis.", "qID": "f8691bdd04254433a162cdef7998689e"}

{"question": "Mutation of which gene is implicated in the Christianson syndrome?", "context": "Mutations in a gene located on chromosome Xq26.3 encoding a protein mainly expressed in early and recycling endosomes are known to cause a complex and slowly progressive degenerative human neurological disease. Three resulting phenotypes have so far been reported: an X-linked Angelman syndrome-like condition, Christianson syndrome and corticobasal degeneration with tau deposition, each characterized by severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, autistic behaviour and ataxia. Hypothesizing a deficiency in this protein would most likely disrupt the endosomal-lysosomal system of neurons, researchers examined knockout mice with tissue staining and related techniques commonly used to study lysosomal storage disorders. As a result, they found that depletion of this protein leads to abnormal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside and unesterified cholesterol within late endosomes and lysosomes of neurons in selective brain regions, most notably the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, the CA3 and CA4 regions and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and some areas of cerebral cortex. In these select neuronal populations, histochemical staining for β-hexosaminidase activity, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of GM2 ganglioside, was undetectable. Neuroaxonal dystrophy similar to that observed in lysosomal disease was observed in the cerebellum and was accompanied by a marked and progressive loss of Purkinje cells, particularly in those lacking the expression of Zebrin II. On behavioural testing, knockout mice displayed a discrete clinical phenotype attributable to motor hyperactivity and cerebellar dysfunction. Importantly, these findings show that loss of function in the gene-targeted mouse model leads to compromise of endosomal-lysosomal function similar to lysosomal disease and to conspicuous neuronal abnormalities in specific brain regions, which in concert could provide a unified explanation for the cellular and clinical phenotypes in humans with mutations at this location.", "qID": "3b4719a2c58345f4acb8bac904ff6d5c"}
{"question": "Mutation of which gene is associated with McLeod syndrome?", "context": "The McLeod syndrome is an X-linked neuroacanthocytosis manifesting with myopathy and progressive chorea. It is caused by mutations of a gene encoding a putative membrane transport protein of yet unknown function. In erythroid tissues, this protein forms a functional complex with the Kell glycoprotein. Here, we present an immunohistochemical study in skeletal muscle of normal controls and a McLeod patient using affinity-purified antibodies against certain proteins. Histological examination of the affected muscle revealed the typical pattern of McLeod myopathy including type 2 fiber atrophy. In control muscles, Kell immunohistochemistry stained sarcoplasmic membranes. Immunohistochemistry resulted in a type 2 fiber-specific intracellular staining that was most probably confined to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, there was only a weak background signal without a specific staining pattern in the McLeod muscle. Our results demonstrate that the lack of physiological expression of the affected protein correlates to the type 2 fiber atrophy in McLeod myopathy, and suggest that this protein represents a crucial factor for the maintenance of normal muscle structure and function.", "qID": "f252703de7194f1983547f4bf860ba40"}

{"question": "Which is the primary protein component of Lewy bodies?", "context": "It is increasingly clear that the normal protein is in some manner closely associated with presynaptic components of select neuronal types within the adult human central nervous system (CNS). By having the antibody AFshp raised specifically to label disease-specific Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites as well as synaptic boutons containing an unaltered protein, an initial attempt is made to map the overall distribution pattern and describe the staining behavior of the immunoreactive punctae in select regions of the prosencephalon. Neocortical immunolabeling is most prominent in the prodigious, but incompletely myelinated, association fields and faintest in the heavily myelinated primary motor and primary sensory fields, with the premotor and first order sensory association areas occupying an intermediate position. Of the thalamic grays evaluated, those containing powerfully myelinated fiber tracts (e.g. centrum medianum, habenular complex) show the weakest immunolabeling, whereas, less sturdily myelinated structures are highly immunoreactive. The fact that the immunostaining spectrum is so broad, together with the fact that some thalamic sites actually are immunonegative leads to the following conclusions (1) the protein, although present in the synaptic boutons of many nerve cells in the adult human CNS, is by no means ubiquitous there, and (2) neuronal types lacking the normal protein cannot generate the specific filamentous pathology.", "qID": "56f2ae49145640039f519cc53fd849b2"}

{"question": "Which is the histone residue methylated by MLL1?", "context": "Constitutive nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation in haematological malignancies is caused in several cases by loss of function mutations within the coding sequence of NF-kappaB inhibitory molecules such as IkappaBalpha or p100. Hut-78, a truncated form of p100, constitutively generates p52 and contributes to the development of T-cell lymphomas but the molecular mechanism underlying this oncogenic potential remains unclear. We show here that MMP9 gene expression is induced through the alternative NF-kappaB-activating pathway in fibroblasts and also on Hut-78 or p52 overexpression in fibroblasts as well as in lymphoma cells. p52 is critical for Hut-78-mediated MMP9 gene induction as a Hut-78 mutant as well as other truncated NF-kappaB2 proteins that are not processed into p52 failed to induce the expression of this metalloproteinase. Conversely, MMP9 gene expression is impaired in p52-depleted HUT-78 cells. Interestingly, MLL1 and MLL2 are tethered by p52 on the MMP9 promoter, and the activity recruited on the MMP9 promoter is impaired in p52-depleted HUT-78 cells. Moreover, MLL1 and MLL2 are associated with Hut-78 in a native chromatin-enriched extract. Thus, we identified a molecular mechanism by which the recruitment of a chromatin-modifying complex on the promoter of a NF-kappaB-dependent gene induces its expression and potentially the invasive potential of lymphoma cells harbouring constitutive activity of the alternative NF-kappaB-activating pathway.", "qID": "df4391d3d5f2494faee51e0fa0eb024c"}

{"question": "What is the mode of inheritance of Romano Ward long QT syndrome?", "context": "Patients with Romano Ward long QT syndrome suffer from syncopal attacks often resulting in sudden cardiac death. The main diagnostic parameter is a prolonged QT(c) interval as judged by electro-cardiographic investigation. LQTS is a genetically heterogeneous disease with four loci having been identified to date: chromosome 11p15.5 (LQT1), 7q35-36 (LQT2), 3p21-24 (LQT3) and 4q25-26 (LQT4). The corresponding genes code for potassium channels KVLQT1 (LQT1) and HERG (LQT2) and the sodium channel SCN5A (LQT3). The KVLQT1 gene is characterized by six transmembrane domains (S1-S6), a pore region situated between the S5 and S6 domains and a C-terminal domain accounting for approximately 60% of the channel. This domain is thought to be co-associated with another protein, viz. minK (minimal potassium channel). We have studied a Romano Ward family with several affected individuals showing a severe LQTS phenotype (syncopes and occurrence of sudden death). Most affected individuals had considerable prolongations of QT(c). By using haplotyping with a set of markers covering the four LQT loci, linkage was investigated but results were inclusive. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing were used to screen the KVLQT1 gene for mutations in the S1-S6 region, including the pore domain. A Gly-216-Arg substitution was identified and its presence correlated with disease in the studied family, raising questions about the specific effects of this mutation.", "qID": "c68098a2b69d435d846e9305f82a5432"}
{"question": "Which deficiency is the cause of restless leg syndrome?", "context": "Iron deficiency is a frequent side effect of blood donation. In recent years, several studies have described genetic variants associated with iron concentrations. However, the impact of these variants on iron levels is unknown in blood donors. Knowledge of genetic variants that predispose donors to iron deficiency would allow bleeding frequency and iron supplementation to be tailored to the individual donor. The genotypes of five specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes that have been previously associated with iron status and/or restless leg syndrome (RLS) were investigated in two groups of female blood donors. The first group had low iron stores (serum ferritin ≤ 12 µg/L, n = 657), and the second group had normal to high iron stores (serum ferritin > 30 µg/L, n = 645). Genotype distribution for each of the SNPs was compared between the two groups. The odds ratio for low serum ferritin was 1.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.77; p = 0.03) when comparing donors with the TT genotype with donors with the CT genotype.

{"question": "Which gene strand is targeted by transcription-coupled repair (TCR)?", "context": "It has been previously shown that disruption of RAD26 in yeast strain W303-1B results in a strain that is deficient in a specific DNA repair mechanism. RAD26 encodes a protein that is homologous to Cockayne syndrome group B protein (CSB) and is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of DNA-dependent ATPases involved in chromatin remodeling. Like the rad26 mutant, cells from Cockayne syndrome patients are defective in this DNA repair process. We examined the role of Rad26 by disrupting RAD26 in two repair-proficient laboratory strains and observed no effect upon this repair mechanism. Our results indicate that disruption of RAD26 alone is insufficient to impair this repair process. Thus, W303-1B must already possess a mutation that, together with disruption of RAD26, causes a deficiency in this DNA repair process. We suggest that other genes are mutated in Cockayne syndrome cells that contribute to the deficiency in this DNA repair process. Surprisingly, deletion of RAD26 results in expression of genes that are repressed by flanking transposon delta elements, an Spt(-) phenotype.

{"question": "Which is the protein implicated in Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3?", "context": "The disease protein in a specific neurodegenerative disorder is a cysteine protease involved in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. It contains multiple ubiquitin binding sites through which it anchors polyubiquitin chains of different linkages that are then cleaved by the N-terminal catalytic domain. The properties of the ubiquitin interacting motifs in the C-terminus are well established. Very little is known, however, about how two recently identified ubiquitin-binding sites in the catalytic domain contribute to ubiquitin chain binding and cleavage. In the current study, we sought to define the specific contribution of the catalytic domain to the catalytic properties and assess how the topology and affinity of these binding sites modulate activity. Using NMR we modeled the structure of diUb/catalytic domain complexes and showed that linkage preferences are imposed by the topology of the two binding sites. Enzymatic studies further helped us to determine a precise hierarchy between the sites. We establish that the structure of the catalytic domain dictates specificity for K48-linked chains. Site 1, which is close to the active site, is indispensable for cleavage. Our studies open the way to understand better the cellular function and its link to pathology.", "qID": "5e25c3d45f5646e79edcd84d6308a178"}

{"question": "Which is the gene mutated in type 1 neurofibromatosis?", "context": "CpG dinucleotides provide hotspots for transitional mutations in a variety of genes, some leading to genetic diseases in humans. Although this phenomenon is attributed to cytosine methylation at such sites, direct and specific observations of CpG methylation at the sites of recurrent mutations are lacking. We have used a bisulfite genomic sequencing method to analyze DNA methylation within three representative exons from a well-known gene, recognized for its high frequency of spontaneous mutations. We observed that the cytosine methylation within these exons is restricted to CpG dinucleotides, including a CpG dinucleotide present at the site of a recurrent mutation. At several sites, clone-specific methylation differences were also observed. Our results provide experimental evidence for the hypothesis that methylatable CpGs contribute to spontaneous germline mutations associated with this gene, by showing that DNA methylation does occur at all CpGs contained within these representative exons. As well, the DNA methylation seen at the common mutation site may explain why this site is frequently mutated. Methylation-dependent mutagenesis may also provide a basis for some somatic (second hit) mutations which disable the normal allele and result in the development of associated symptoms.", "qID": "6246c07c53fc4659a83f4955f195a4be"}
{"question": "Which gene is mutated in a subtype of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy known as Naxos disease?", "context": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an autosomal dominant heart muscle disorder that causes arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. Previously we mapped the genetic locus for the triad of autosomal recessive ARVC, palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair (Naxos disease) to chromosome 17q21. This protein is a key component of desmosomes and adherens junctions, and is important for the tight adhesion of many cell types, including those in the heart and skin. We studied 19 individuals with Naxos disease, as well as unaffected family members and unrelated individuals from the neighbouring Greek islands of Naxos and Milos. Gene sequence was determined by reverse transcriptase PCR from RNA isolated from the skin of an affected individual and mutations in other cases were confirmed by restriction-enzyme analysis. A homozygous 2 base pair deletion was identified only in the 19 affected individuals. This deletion caused a frameshift and premature termination of the protein, which was shown by western blot analysis. 29 clinically unaffected family members were heterozygous for the mutation; 20 unrelated individuals from Naxos and 43 autosomal dominant ARVC probands were homozygous for the normal allele. The finding of a deletion suggests that the proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion play an important part in maintaining myocyte integrity, and when junctions are disrupted, cell death, and fibrofatty replacement occur. Therefore, the discovery of a mutation in a protein with functions in maintaining cell junction integrity has important implications for other dominant forms of ARVC, related cardiomyopathies, and other cutaneous diseases.", "qID": "204004adaf394da29332aa0a6d83a243"}

{"question": "Which deficiency is the cause of restless leg syndrome?", "context": "There may be a relationship between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and nutrient absorption, specifically due to alteration of the pH in the duodenum. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that includes an urge to move legs, accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, the urge to move is partially or totally relieved by movement, and the urge is worse or only occurs at night. In the majority of the restless leg syndrome population, the sensation is deep seated, often described as being in the shin bones, and most commonly felt between the knee and ankle. It may be described as a creepy, shock-like, tense, electric, buzzing, itchy, or even numb sensation. A subpopulation of this restless leg syndrome patient population experiences restless leg syndrome associated pain (RLSAP) that has been described as a deep \"achy pain.\" This pain has not been found to be relieved by many of the typical over the counter analgesics. Often, constant movement of the legs appears to be the only remedy, as these sensations usually appear during periods of rest. The authors theorize about a possible correlation between PPIs and the symptoms (e.g. pain) associated with RLS. The authors propose that PPIs, such as omeprazole, may interfere with nutrient absorption in certain patients. While there is no robust direct evidence to support any specific associations of PPIs with nutrient deficiencies or PPIs associated with RLS-like symptoms (including RLSAP), it is hoped that this manuscript may spark research efforts on this issue.", "qID": "98b6b16cb95a49bd915989305b3d7d4c"}

It focuses on removing transcription-blocking DNA lesions, thus facilitating the swift continuation of transcription. A defect in TCR causes the rare hereditary disorder Cockayne syndrome (CS). Recently we found that mutations in the ERCC6 repair gene, encoding a putative helicase, underly the repair defect of CS complementation group B. Here we report the cloning and characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of CSB/ERCC6, which we designate RAD26. A rad26 disruption mutant appears viable and grows normally, indicating that the gene does not have an essential function. In analogy with CS, preferential repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in an unspecified strand of the active RBP2 gene is severely impaired. Surprisingly, in contrast to the human CS mutant, yeast RAD26 disruption does not induce any UV-, cisPt- or X-ray sensitivity, explaining why it was not isolated as a mutant before. Recovery of growth after UV exposure was somewhat delayed in rad26.

{"question": "Which is the protein implicated in Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3?", "context": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most frequent inherited cerebellar ataxia in Europe, the US and Japan, leading to disability and death through motor complications. Although the affected protein is found ubiquitously in the brain, grey matter atrophy is predominant in the cerebellum and the brainstem. White matter pathology is generally less severe and thought to occur in the brainstem, spinal cord, and cerebellar white matter. Here, we investigated both grey and white matter pathology in a group of 12 SCA3 patients and matched controls. We used voxel-based morphometry for analysis of tissue loss, and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to investigate microstructural pathology. We analysed correlations between microstructural properties of the brain and ataxia severity, as measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score. SCA3 patients exhibited significant loss of both grey and white matter in the cerebellar hemispheres, brainstem including pons and in lateral thalamus. On between-group analysis, TBSS detected widespread microstructural white matter pathology in the cerebellum, brainstem, and bilaterally in thalamus and the cerebral hemispheres. Furthermore, fractional anisotropy in a white matter network comprising frontal, thalamic, brainstem and left cerebellar white matter strongly and negatively correlated with SARA ataxia scores. Tractography identified the thalamic white matter thus implicated as belonging to ventrolateral thalamus. Disruption of white matter integrity in patients suffering from SCA3 is more widespread than previously thought. Moreover, our data provide evidence that microstructural white matter changes in SCA3 are strongly related to the clinical severity of ataxia symptoms.", "qID": "3b79b6f68f774f36a9a24a3a0960be22"}

{"question": "what did michael faraday discover?", "context": "Magnetism produced by electricity is called electromagnetism. Today, electromagnetism is used in many electric devices. However, until electromagnetism was discovered, scientists thought that electricity and magnetism were unrelated. A Danish scientist named Hans Christian Oersted (pictured in the Figure 1.1) changed all that. He made the important discovery that electric current creates a magnetic field. But like many other important discoveries in science, Oersteds discovery was just a lucky accident. In 1820, Oersted was presenting a demonstration to some science students. Ironically, he was trying to show them that electricity and magnetism are not related. He placed a wire with electric current flowing through it next to a compass, which has a magnetic needle. As he expected, the needle of the compass didnt move. It just kept pointing toward Earths north magnetic pole. After the demonstration, a curious student held the wire near the compass again, but in a different direction. To Oersteds surprise, the needle of the compass swung toward the wire so it was no longer pointing north. Oersted was intrigued. He turned off the current in the wire to see what would happen to the compass needle. The needle swung back to its original position, pointing north once again. Oersted had discovered that an electric current creates a magnetic field. The magnetic field created by the current was strong enough to attract the needle of the nearby compass.

All living things: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. are made of one or more cells. need energy to stay alive. respond to stimuli in their environment. grow and reproduce. maintain a stable internal environment. Cells are the basic building blocks of life. They are like tiny factories where virtually all life processes take place. Some living things, like the bacteria in Figure 2.1, consist of just one cell. They are called single-celled organisms. You can see other single-celled organisms in Figure 2.2. Some living things are composed of a few to many cells. Regardless of the type of organism, all living cells share certain basic structures. For example, all cells are enclosed by a membrane. The cell membrane separates the cell from its environment. It also controls what enters or leaves the cell. Everything you do takes energy. Energy is the ability to change or move matter. Whether its reading these words or running a sprint, it requires energy. In fact, it takes energy just to stay alive. Where do you get energy? You probably know the answer. You get energy from food. Figure {{ref|MS-LS-SE-02-03-Food|below}] shows some healthy foods that can provide you with energy. Just like you, other living things need a source of energy. But they may use a different source. Organisms may be grouped on the basis of the source of energy they use. In which group do you belong? Producers such as the tree in Figure 2.1 use sunlight for energy to produce their own food. The process is called photosynthesis, and the food is sugar. Plants and other organisms use this food for energy. Consumers such as the raccoon in Figure 2.1 eat plants or other consumers that eat plants as a source of energy. Some consumers such as the mushroom in Figure 2.1 get their energy from dead organic matter. For example, they might consume dead leaves on a forest floor. When a living thing responds to its environment, it is responding to a stimulus. A stimulus (stimuli, plural) is something in the environment that causes a reaction in an organism. The reaction a stimulus produces is called a response. Imagine how you would respond to the following stimuli: Youre about to cross a street when the walk light turns red. You hear a smoke alarm go off in the kitchen. You step on an upturned tack with a bare foot. You smell the aroma of your favorite food. You taste something really sour. It doesnt take much imagination to realize that responding appropriately to such stimuli might help keep you safe. It might even help you survive. Like you, all other living things sense and respond to stimuli in their environment. In general, their responses help them survive or reproduce.

By adulthood, they will be able to reproduce. Reproduction is the production of offspring. The ability to reproduce is another characteristic of living things. Many organisms reproduce sexually. In sexual reproduction, parents of different sexes mate to produce offspring. The offspring have some combination of the traits of the two parents. Ducks are examples of sexually reproducing organisms. Other organisms reproduce asexually. In asexual reproduction, a single parent can produce offspring alone.

{"question": "this much of the universe is made up of dark matter.", "context": "The things we observe in space are objects that emit some type of electromagnetic radiation. However, scientists think that matter that emits light makes up only a small part of the matter in the universe. Dark matter emits no electromagnetic radiation, so we can't observe it directly. However, astronomers know that dark matter exists because its gravity affects the motion of objects around it. When astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate, they find that the outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than they can see. Gravitational lensing occurs when light is bent from a very distant bright source around a super-massive object (Figure 1.1). To explain strong gravitational lensing, more matter than is observed must be present. With so little to go on, astronomers don't really know much about the nature of dark matter. One possibility is that it could just be ordinary matter that does not emit radiation in objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and brown dwarfs – objects larger than Jupiter but smaller than the smallest stars. But astronomers cannot find enough of these types of objects, which they have named MACHOs (massive astrophyiscal compact halo object), to account for all the dark matter, so they are thought to be only a small part of the total. Another possibility is that the dark matter is very different from the ordinary matter we see. Some appear to be particles that have gravity, but don't otherwise appear to interact with other particles. Scientists call these theoretical particles WIMPs, which stands for Weakly Interactive Massive Particles. Most scientists who study dark matter think that the dark matter in the universe is a combination of MACHOs and some type of exotic matter, such as WIMPs. Researching dark matter is an active area of scientific research, and astronomers' knowledge about dark matter is changing rapidly. Astronomers who study the expansion of the universe are interested in knowing the rate of that expansion. Is the rate fast enough to overcome the attractive pull of gravity? If yes, then the universe will expand forever, although the expansion will slow down over time. If no, then the universe would someday start to contract, and eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch, the opposite of the Big Bang. Recently, astronomers have made a discovery that answers that question: the rate at which the universe is expanding is actually increasing. In other words, the universe is expanding faster now than ever before, and in the future it will expand even faster. So now astronomers think that the universe will keep expanding forever. But it also proposes a perplexing new question: what is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate? One possible hypothesis involves a new, hypothetical form of energy called dark energy (Figure 1.2). Some scientists think that dark energy makes up as much as 71% of the total energy content of the universe. Today matter makes up a small percentage of the universe, but at the start of the universe it made up much more. Where did dark energy, if it even exists, come from? Other scientists have other hypotheses about why the universe is continuing to expand; the causes of the universe's expansion is another unanswered question that scientists are researching.

{"question": "example of a negative ion", "context": "An ionic bond is the force of attraction that holds together positive and negative ions. It forms when atoms of a metallic element give up electrons to atoms of a nonmetallic element. Figure 7.3 shows how this happens. In row 1 of Figure 7.3, an atom of sodium donates an electron to an atom of a non-specified element. By losing an electron, the sodium atom becomes a sodium ion. It now has one less electron than protons, giving it a charge of +1. Positive ions such as sodium are given the same name as the element. The chemical symbol has a plus sign to distinguish the ion from an atom of the element. The symbol for a sodium ion is Na+. By gaining an electron, the non-specified element's atom becomes a negatively charged ion. It now has one more electron than protons, giving it a charge of -1. Negative ions are named by adding the suffix ide to the first part of the element name. The symbol for the negative ion is not specified. Sodium and the negative ion have equal but opposite charges. Opposites attract, so they attract each other and cling together in a strong ionic bond. You can see this in row 2 of Figure 7.3. Brackets separate the ions in the diagram to show that the ions in the compound do not share electrons. You can see animations of ionic bonding at these URLs: http://web.jjay.cuny.edu/~acarpi/NSC/salt.htm Ionic bonds form only between metals and nonmetals. Metals \"want\" to give up electrons, and nonmetals \"want\" to gain electrons. Find sodium (Na) in Figure 7.4. Sodium is an alkali metal in group 1. Like other group 1 elements, it has just one valence electron. If sodium loses that one electron, it will have a full outer energy level. Now find fluorine (F) in Figure 7.4. Fluorine is a halogen in group 17. It has seven valence electrons. If fluorine gains one electron, it will have a full outer energy level. After sodium gives up its valence electron to fluorine, both atoms have a more stable arrangement of electrons. It takes energy to remove valence electrons from an atom. The force of attraction between the negative electrons and positive nucleus must be overcome. The amount of energy needed depends on the element. Less energy is needed to remove just one or a few electrons than many. This explains why sodium and other alkali metals form positive ions so easily. Less energy is also needed to remove electrons from larger atoms in the same group. For example, in group 1, it takes less energy to remove an electron from francium (Fr) at the bottom of the group than from lithium (Li) at the top of the group (see Figure 7.4). In bigger atoms, valence electrons are farther from the nucleus. As a result, the force of attraction between the electrons and nucleus is weaker. What happens when an atom gains an electron and becomes a negative ion? Energy is released. Halogens release the most energy when they form ions. As a result, they are very reactive. Ionic compounds contain ions of metals and nonmetals held together by ionic bonds. Ionic compounds do not form molecules. Instead, many positive and negative ions bond together to form a structure called a crystal. You can see an example of a crystal in Figure 7.5. It shows the ionic compound sodium chloride. Positive sodium ions (Na+) alternate with negative ions (not specified). The oppositely charged ions are strongly attracted to each other. Helpful Hints Naming Ionic Compounds Ionic compounds are named for their positive and negative ions. The name of the positive The crystal structure of ionic compounds is strong and rigid. It takes a lot of energy to break all those strong ionic bonds. As a result, ionic compounds are solids with high melting and boiling points (see Table 7.2).

{"question": "speed of a moving object at a given moment", "context": "Speed is an important aspect of motion. It is a measure of how fast or slow something moves. It depends on how far something travels and how long it takes to travel that far. Speed can be calculated using this general formula: speed = distance / time. A familiar example is the speed of a car. In the U.S., this is usually expressed in miles per hour (see Figure 12.6). The speed of a car may also be expressed in kilometers per hour (km/h). The SI unit for speed is meters per second (m/s). When you travel by car, you usually don’t move at a constant speed. Instead, you go faster or slower depending on speed limits, traffic, traffic lights, and many other factors. For example, you might travel 65 miles per hour on a highway but only 20 miles per hour on a city street (see Figure 12.7). You might come to a complete stop at traffic lights, slow down as you turn corners, and speed up to pass other cars. It's easier to calculate the average speed of a moving object than to determine its speed at every moment.

URL:  The motion of an object can be represented by a distance-time graph like the one in Figure 12.8. A distance-time graph shows how the distance from the starting point changes over time. The graph in Figure 12.8 represents a bike trip. The trip began at 7:30 AM (A) and ended at 12:30 PM (F). The rider traveled from the starting point to a destination and then returned to the starting point again. In a distance-time graph, the speed of the object is represented by the slope, or steepness, of the graph line. If the line is straight, like the line between A and B in Figure 12.8, then the speed is constant. The average speed can be calculated from the graph. The change in distance (represented by Dd) divided by the change in time (represented by Dt): speed = Dd / Dt. For example, the speed between A and B in Figure 12.8 is: speed = 20 km/h. If the graph line is horizontal, as it is between B and C, then the slope and the speed are zero: speed = 0 km/h.", "qID": "c009d29b1940407ca91d506ba0080878"}
{"question": "in gasification, this rock is heated to extremely high temperature to create syngas, which is then filtered.", "context": "The Clean Air Act of 1970 and the amendments since then have done a great job in requiring people to clean up the air over the United States. Emissions of the six major pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act — carbon monoxide, lead, nitrous oxides, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulates — have decreased by more than 50%. Cars, power plants, and factories individually release less pollution than they did in the mid-20th century. But there are many more cars, power plants, and factories. Many pollutants are still being released and some substances have been found to be pollutants that were not known to be pollutants in the past. There is still much work to be done to continue to clean up the air. Reducing air pollution from vehicles can be done in a number of ways. Breaking down pollutants before they are released into the atmosphere. Motor vehicles emit less pollution than they once did because of catalytic converters (Figure 1.1). Catalytic converters contain a catalyst that speeds up chemical reactions and breaks down nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide, and VOCs. Catalytic converters only work when they are hot, so a lot of exhaust escapes as the car is warming up. Catalytic converters are placed on modern cars in the United States. Making a vehicle more fuel efficient. Lighter, more streamlined vehicles need less energy. Hybrid vehicles have an electric motor and a rechargeable battery. The energy that would be lost during braking is funneled into charging the battery, which then can power the car. The internal combustion engine only takes over when power in the battery has run out. Hybrids can reduce auto emissions by 90% or more, but many models do not maximize the possible fuel efficiency of the vehicle. A plug-in hybrid is plugged into an electricity source when it is not in use, perhaps in a garage, to make sure that the battery is charged. Plug-in hybrids run for a longer time on electricity and so are less polluting than regular hybrids. Plug-in hybrids began to become available in 2010. Developing new technologies that do not use fossil fuels. Fueling a car with something other than a liquid organic-based fuel is difficult. A fuel cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy. Hydrogen fuel cells harness the energy released when hydrogen and oxygen come together to create water (Figure 1.2). Fuel cells are extremely efficient and they produce no pollutants. But developing fuel-cell technology has had many problems and no one knows when or if they will become practical. Pollutants are removed from the exhaust streams of power plants and industrial plants before they enter the atmosphere. Particulates can be filtered out, and sulfur and nitric oxides can be broken down by catalysts. Removing these oxides reduces the pollutants that cause acid rain. Particles are relatively easy to remove from emissions by using motion or electricity to separate particles from the gases. Scrubbers remove particles and waste gases from exhaust using liquids or neutralizing materials (Figure 1.3). Gases, such as nitrogen oxides, can be broken down at very high temperatures. A hydrogen fuel-cell car looks like a gasoline-powered car. Scrubbers remove particles and waste gases from exhaust. Gasification is a developing technology. In this process, organic material is heated to extremely high temperatures to create syngas, which is then filtered. The energy goes on to drive a generator. Syngas releases about 80% less pollution than regular plants, and greenhouse gases are also lower. Although the technology is ready, these plants are more expensive to construct and operate. Also, heating the material to high enough temperatures uses a great deal of energy, so the technology is not energy efficient. In addition, large amounts of the greenhouse gas CO2 are still released with this technology. Nonetheless, a few of these plants are operating in the United States and around the world. How can air pollution be reduced? Using less fossil fuel is one way to lessen pollution. Some examples of ways to conserve fossil fuels are: Riding a bike or walking instead of driving", "qID": "8314e1fb8584489281ef1dd304098766"}
{"question": "table based on the atomic number of elements", "context": "Mendeleev was a teacher as well as a chemist. He was writing a chemistry textbook and needed a way to organize the elements so it would be easier for students to learn about them. He made a set of cards of the elements, similar to a deck of playing cards, with one element per card. On the card, he wrote the elements name, atomic mass, and known properties. He arranged and rearranged the cards in many different ways, looking for a pattern. He finally found it when he placed the elements in order by atomic mass. You can see how Mendeleev organized the elements in Figure 6.2. From left to right across each row, elements are arranged by increasing atomic mass. Mendeleev discovered that if he placed eight elements in each row and then continued on to the next row, the columns of the table would contain elements with similar properties. He called the columns groups. They are sometimes called families, because elements within a group are similar but not identical to one another, like people in a family. Mendeleevs table of the elements is called a periodic table because of its repeating pattern. Anything that keeps repeating is referred to as periodic. Other examples of things that are periodic include the monthly phases of the moon and the daily cycle of night and day. The term period refers to the interval between repetitions. In a periodic table, the periods are the rows of the table. In Mendeleevs table, each period contains eight elements, and then the pattern repeats in the next row. Did you notice the blanks in Mendeleevs table (Figure 6.2)? They are spaces that Mendeleev left for elements that had not yet been discovered when he created his table. He predicted that these missing elements would eventually be discovered. Based on their position in the table, he could even predict their properties. For example, he predicted a missing element in row 5 of his group 3. He said it would have an atomic mass of about 68 and be a soft metal like other group 3 elements. Scientists searched for the missing element. They found it a few years later and named it gallium. Scientists searched for the other missing elements. Eventually, all of them were found. An important measure of a good model is its ability to make accurate predictions. This makes it a useful model. Clearly, Mendeleevs periodic table was a useful model. It helped scientists discover new elements and make sense of those that were already known.", "qID": "675dda6b5cd04f76862df1aeb041edb8"}

Instead, they can be recycled and used over and over again. Living things are also renewable resources. They can reproduce to replace themselves. However, living things can be over-used or misused to the point of extinction. For example, over-fishing has caused some of the best fishing spots in the ocean to be nearly depleted, threatening entire fish species with extinction. To be truly renewable, living things must be used wisely. They must be used in a way that meets the needs of the present generation but also preserves them for future generations. Using resources in this way is called sustainable use. Nonrenewable resources are natural resources that cant be remade or else take too long to remake to keep up with human use. Examples of nonrenewable resources are coal, oil, and natural gas, all of which are fossil fuels. Fossil fuels form from the remains of plants and animals over hundreds of millions of years. We are using them up far faster than they can be replaced. At current rates of use, oil and natural gas will be used up in just a few decades, and coal will be used up in a couple of centuries. Uranium is another nonrenewable resource. It is used to produce nuclear power. Uranium is a naturally occurring chemical element that cant be remade.

{"question": "New atoms of carbon-14 form in the atmosphere because of", "context": "Radioactive decay is the breakdown of unstable elements into stable elements. To understand this process, recall that the atoms of all elements contain the particles protons, neutrons, and electrons. An element is defined by the number of protons it contains. All atoms of a given element contain the same number of protons. The number of neutrons in an element may vary. Atoms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Consider carbon as an example. Two isotopes of carbon are shown in Figure 11.15. Compare their protons and neutrons. Both contain 6 protons. But carbon-12 has 6 neutrons and carbon-14 has 8 neutrons. Almost all carbon atoms are carbon-12. This is a stable isotope of carbon. Only a tiny percentage of carbon atoms are carbon-14. Carbon-14 is unstable. Figure 11.16 shows carbon dioxide, which forms in the atmosphere from carbon-14 and oxygen. Carbon in the atmosphere combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Plants take in carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. In this way, carbon-14 enters food chains. Like other unstable isotopes, carbon-14 breaks down, or decays. For carbon-14 decay, each carbon-14 atom loses an alpha particle. It changes to a stable atom of nitrogen-14. This is illustrated in Figure 11.17. The decay of an unstable isotope to a stable element occurs at a constant rate. This rate is different for each isotope pair. The decay rate is measured in a unit called the half-life. The half-life is the time it takes for half of a given amount of an isotope to decay. For example, the half-life of carbon-14 is 5730 years. Imagine that you start out with 100 grams of carbon-14. In 5730 years, half of it decays. This leaves 50 grams of carbon-14. Over the next 5730 years, half of the remaining amount will decay. Now there are 25 grams of carbon-14. How many grams will there be in another 5730 years? Figure 11.18 graphs the rate of decay of carbon-14. The rate of decay of unstable isotopes can be used to estimate the absolute ages of fossils and rocks. This type of dating is called radiometric dating. The best-known method of radiometric dating is carbon-14 dating. A living thing takes in carbon-14 (along with stable carbon-12). As the carbon-14 decays, it is replaced with more carbon-14. After the organism dies, it stops taking in carbon. That includes carbon-14. The carbon-14 that is in its body continues to decay. So the organism contains less and less carbon-14 as time goes on. We can estimate the amount of carbon-14 that has decayed by measuring the amount of carbon-14 to carbon-12. We know how fast carbon-14 decays. With this information, we can tell how long ago the organism died. Carbon-14 has a relatively short half-life. It decays quickly compared to some other unstable isotopes. So carbon- 14 dating is useful for specimens younger than 50,000 years old. Thats a blink of an eye in geologic time. But radiocarbon dating is very useful for more recent events. One important use of radiocarbon is early human sites. Carbon-14 dating is also limited to the remains of once-living things. To date rocks, scientists use other radioactive isotopes. The isotopes in Table 11.1 are used to date igneous rocks. These isotopes have much longer half-lives than carbon- 14. Because they decay more slowly, they can be used to date much older specimens. Which of these isotopes could be used to date a rock that formed half a million years ago?

{"question": "Asexual reproduction", "context": "Asexual reproduction involves just one parent. The offspring are genetically identical to each other and to the parent. All prokaryotes and some eukaryotes reproduce this way. There are several different methods of asexual reproduction. They include binary fission, fragmentation, and budding. Binary fission occurs when a parent cell simply splits into two daughter cells. This method is described in detail in the lesson \"Cell Division.\" Bacteria reproduce this way. You can see a bacterial cell reproducing by binary fission in Figure 5.9. Fragmentation occurs when a piece breaks off from a parent organism. Then the piece develops into a new organism. Sea stars, like the one in Figure 5.10, can reproduce this way. In fact, a new sea star can form from a single arm. Budding occurs when a parent cell forms a bubble-like bud. The bud stays attached to the parent while it grows and develops. It breaks away from the parent only after it is fully formed. Yeasts can reproduce this way. You can see two yeast cells budding in Figure 5.11. Sexual reproduction involves two parents. Special cells called gametes are produced by the parents. An offspring forms when two gametes unite. The union of the two gametes is called fertilization. You can see a human sperm and egg uniting in Figure 5.12. The initial cell that forms when two gametes unite is called a zygote. In species with sexual reproduction, each cell of the body has two copies of each chromosome. For example, human beings have 23 different chromosomes. Each body cell contains two of each chromosome, for a total of 46 chromosomes. You can see the 23 pairs of human chromosomes in Figure 5.13. The number of different types of chromosomes is called the haploid number. In humans, the haploid number is 23. The number of chromosomes in normal body cells is called the diploid number. The diploid number is twice the haploid number. In humans, the diploid number is two times 23, or 46. The two members of a given pair of chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes. We get one of each homologous pair, or 23 chromosomes, from our father. We get the other one of each pair, or 23 chromosomes, from our mother. A gamete must have the haploid number of chromosomes. That way, when two gametes unite, the zygote will have the diploid number. How are haploid cells produced? The answer is meiosis. Meiosis is a special type of cell division. It produces haploid daughter cells. It occurs when an organism makes gametes. Meiosis is basically mitosis times two. The original diploid cell divides twice. The first time is called meiosis I. The second time is called meiosis II. However, the DNA replicates only once. It replicates before meiosis I but not before meiosis II. This results in four haploid daughter cells. Meiosis I and meiosis II occurs in the same four phases as mitosis. The phases are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. However, meiosis I has an important difference. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up and then separate. As a result, each daughter cell has only one chromosome from each homologous pair. Figure 5.14 is a simple model of meiosis. It shows both meiosis I and II. You can read more about the stages below. You can also learn more about them by watching this video: . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

While temperatures have risen since the end of the Pleistocene, 10,000 years ago, this rate of increase has been more rapid in the past century, and has risen even faster since 1990. The 10 warmest years in the 134-year record have all occurred since in the 21st century, and only one year during the 20th century (1998) was warmer than 2013, the 4th warmest year on record (through 2013) (Figure 1.1). The 2000s were the warmest decade yet. Annual variations aside, the average global temperature increased about 0.8o C (1.5o F) between 1880 and 2010, according to the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NOAA. This number doesnt seem very large. Why is it important? The United States has long been the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, with about 20% of total emissions in 2004. As a result of China's rapid economic growth, its emissions surpassed those of the United States in 2008. However, its also important to keep in mind that the United States has only about one-fifth the population of China. Whats the significance of this? The average United States citizen produces far more greenhouse gas emissions than the average Chinese person.

{"question": "Without certain organisms that live in soil, plants would not be able to use", "context": "Carbon is an element. By itself, it's a black solid. You can see a lump of carbon in Figure 18.10. Carbon is incredibly important because of what it makes when it combines with many other elements. Carbon can form a wide variety of substances. For example, in the air, carbon combines with oxygen to form the gas carbon dioxide. In living things, carbon combines with several other elements. In the carbon cycle, carbon moves through living and nonliving things. Carbon actually moves through two cycles that overlap. One cycle is mainly biotic; the other cycle is mainly abiotic. Both cycles are shown in Figure 18.11. Producers such as plants or algae use carbon dioxide in the air to make food. The organisms combine carbon dioxide with water to make sugar. They store the sugar as starch. Both sugar and starch are carbohydrates. Consumers get carbon when they eat producers or other consumers. Carbon doesn't stop there. Living things get energy from food in a process called respiration. This releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. The cycle then repeats. Carbon from decaying organisms enters the ground. Some carbon is stored in the soil. Some carbon may be stored underground for millions of years. This will form fossil fuels. When volcanoes erupt, carbon from the mantle is released as carbon dioxide into the air. Producers take in the carbon dioxide to make food. Then the cycle repeats. The oceans also play an important role in the carbon cycle. Ocean water absorbs carbon dioxide from the air. In fact, the oceans contain 50 times more carbon than the atmosphere. Much of the carbon sinks to the bottom of the oceans, where it may stay for hundreds of years. Human actions are influencing the carbon cycle. Burning of fossil fuels releases the carbon dioxide that was stored in ancient plants. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and is a cause of global warming. Forests are also being destroyed. Trees may be cut down for their wood, or they may be burned to clear the land for farming. Burning wood releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. You can see how a tropical rainforest was cleared for farming in Figure 18.12. With forests shrinking, there are fewer trees to remove carbon dioxide from the air. This makes the greenhouse effect even worse. Air is about 78 percent nitrogen. Living things also need various nutrients for survival, including those that are key elements in proteins and other biological molecules, which are processed through different cycles in the environment.

{"question": "__viral STI that can be prevented with a vaccine", "context": "A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is a disease that spreads mainly through sexual contact. STIs are caused by pathogens that enter the body through the reproductive organs. Many STIs also spread through body fluids such as blood. For example, a shared tattoo needle is one way that some STIs can spread. Some STIs can also spread from a mother to her infant during birth. STIs are more common in teens and young adults than in older people. One reason is that young people are more likely to engage in risky behaviors. They also may not know how STIs spread. Instead, they may believe myths about STIs, like those in Table 22.1. Knowing the facts is important to prevent the spread of STIs. Myth If you are sexually active with just one person, then you cant get STIs. If you dont have any symptoms, then you dont have an STI. Getting STIs is no big deal, because they can be cured with medicines. Fact The only sure way to avoid getting STIs is to practice abstinence from sexual activity. Many STIs do not cause symptoms, especially in fe- males. Only some STIs can be cured with medicines; others cannot be cured. A number of STIs are caused by bacteria. Bacterial STIs can usually be cured with antibiotics. However, some people with bacterial STIs may not have symptoms so they fail to get treatment. Left untreated, these infections may damage reproductive organs and lead to an inability to have children. Three bacterial STIs are chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STI in the U.S. Females are more likely to develop it than males. Symptoms may include burning during urination and a discharge from the vagina or penis. Gonorrhea is another common bacterial STI. Symptoms may include painful urination and a discharge from the vagina or penis. Syphilis is a very serious STI but somewhat less common than chlamydia or gonorrhea. It usually begins with a small sore on the genitals. This is followed a few months later by a rash and flu-like symptoms. If syphilis isnt treated, it can eventually damage the heart, brain, and other organs and even cause death. Several STIs are caused by viruses. Viral STIs cant be cured with antibiotics. Other drugs may help control the symptoms of viral STIs, but the infections usually last for life. Other reproductive system disorders include injuries and noninfectious diseases. These are different in males and females. Most common disorders of the male reproductive system involve the testes. They include injuries and cancer. Injuries to the testes are very common. In teens, such injuries occur most often while playing sports. Injuries to the testes are likely to be very painful and cause bruising and swelling. However, they generally subside fairly quickly. Cancer of the testes is most common in males aged 15 to 35. It occurs when cells in the testes grow out of control and form a tumor. If found early", "qID": "57eb8e4f85fe4f6993aef69ac6b88505"}
{"question": "able to burn easily", "context": "Love Canal gained worldwide attention in the late 1970s when the press started covering its story. The story is outlined below and illustrated in Figure 19.9. The Love Canal disaster actually began back in the mid 1900s. The disaster continues even today. Starting in the early 1940s, a big chemical company put thousands of barrels of chemical waste into an old canal. Over the next 10 years, the company dumped almost 22,000 tons of chemicals into the ground! In the early 1950s, the company covered over the barrels in the canal with soil. Then they sold the land to the city for just a dollar. The city needed the land in order to build an elementary school. The company warned the city that toxic waste was buried there. But they thought the waste was safe. The school and hundreds of homes were also built over the old canal. As it turned out, the cheap price was no bargain. Chemicals started leaking from the barrels. Chemicals seeped into basements. Chemicals bubbled up to the surface of the ground. In some places, plants wouldn't even grow on the soil. People noticed bad smells. Many got sick, especially the children. Residents wanted to know if the old chemicals were the cause. But they had a hard time getting officials to listen. So they demonstrated and demanded answers. Finally, the soil was tested and was found to be contaminated with harmful chemicals. For example, it contained a lot of lead and mercury. Both can cause permanent damage to the human nervous system. The school was closed. More than 200 homes were evacuated. Much of the Love Canal neighborhood was bulldozed away. The area had a massive clean-up effort. The cleanup cost millions of dollars. More than three decades later, much of Love Canal is still too contaminated to be safe for people. Love Canal opened people's eyes to toxic waste burial. They realized there must be other Love Canals all over the country. Thousands of contaminated sites were found. The Superfund Act was passed in 1980. The law required that money be set aside for cleanup of toxic waste sites, like the Elizabeth Copper Mine in Vermont (see the far-right image in Figure 19.9). The law also required safer disposal of hazardous waste in the future. Love Canal highlighted the problem of pollution by hazardous waste. Hazardous waste is any waste that is dangerous to the health of people or the environment. It may be dangerous because it is toxic, corrosive, or explosive. Toxic waste is poisonous. Toxic waste may cause cancer or birth defects in people. It may also harm other living things. Corrosive waste is highly reactive with other substances. Corrosive waste may cause burns or destroy other materials that it touches. Explosive waste is likely to explode. The risk of explosion may be greater if the waste is mixed with other substances. Table 19.1 shows some examples of hazardous waste. Look closely. Are any of these examples lurking around your home? Example Description Cars contain toxic fluids such as brake fluid. The fluids may also be corrosive. This photo shows one way the fluids can end up in the ground. Cars use gas and oil. These materials pollute the land when they leak or spill. Batteries contain toxic and corrosive materials. People often toss them in the trash, but they should be disposed of properly. Electronics, such as old computers, contain toxic chemicals. They may be sent to landfills where the toxic materials end up in the ground. Medical waste can contain many hazards: Human body fluids may cause disease; old thermometers may contain toxic mercury; and pharmaceuticals may be toxic to people and other living things. Example Description Paints may spill on the ground or be thrown improperly in the trash. Chemicals are applied to farm fields and lawns. They include fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Many of these chemicals are toxic to people and other animals. The greatest source of hazardous waste is industry. Agriculture is another major", "qID": "c2011111d54b416396366eb1a91990ee"}
{"question": "mass per volume is", "context": "Minerals are everywhere! Scientists have identified more than 4,000 minerals in Earth's crust, although the bulk of the planet is composed of just a few. A mineral possesses the following qualities: It must be solid. It must be crystalline, meaning it has a repeating arrangement of atoms. It must be naturally occurring. It must be inorganic. It must have a specific chemical composition. Minerals can be identified by their physical properties, such as hardness, color, luster (shininess), and odor. The most common laboratory technique used to identify a mineral is X-ray diffraction (XRD), a technique that involves shining an X-ray light on a sample, and observing how the light exiting the sample is bent. XRD is not useful in the field, however. The definition of a mineral is more restricted than you might think at first. For example, glass is made of sand, which is rich in the mineral quartz. But glass is not a mineral, because it is not crystalline. Instead, glass has a random assemblage of molecules. What about steel? Steel is made by mixing different metal minerals like iron, cobalt, chromium, vanadium, and molybdenum, but steel is not a mineral because it is made by humans and therefore is not naturally occurring. However, almost any rock you pick up is composed of minerals. Below we explore the qualities of minerals in more detail. Minerals are \"crystalline\" solids. A crystal is a solid in which the atoms are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern. Notice that in Figure 1.1 the green and purple spheres, representing sodium and chlorine, form a repeating pattern. In this case, they alternate in all directions. Sodium ions (purple balls) bond with chloride ions (green balls) to make table salt (halite). All of the grains of salt that are in a salt shaker have this crystalline structure. Organic substances are the carbon-based compounds made by living creatures and include proteins, carbohydrates, and oils. Inorganic substances have a structure that is not characteristic of living bodies. Coal is made of plant and animal remains. Is it a mineral? Coal is a classified as a sedimentary rock, but is not a mineral. Minerals are made by natural processes, those that occur in or on Earth. A diamond created deep in Earth's crust is a mineral, but a diamond made in a laboratory by humans is not. Be careful about buying a laboratory-made diamond for jewelry. It may look pretty, but it's not a diamond and is not technically a mineral. Nearly all (98.5%) of Earth's crust is made up of only eight elements - oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium - and these are the elements that make up most minerals. All minerals have a specific chemical composition. The mineral silver is made up of only silver atoms and diamond is made only of carbon atoms, but most minerals are made up of chemical compounds. Each mineral has its own chemical formula. Table salt (also known as halite), pictured in Figure 1.1, is NaCl (sodium chloride). Quartz is always made of two oxygen atoms (red) bonded to a silicon atom (grey), represented by the chemical formula SiO2 (Figure 1.2). Quartz is made of two oxygen atoms (red) bonded to a silicon atom (grey). In nature, things are rarely as simple as in the lab, and so it should not come as a surprise that some minerals have a range of chemical compositions. One important example in Earth science is olivine, which always has silicon and oxygen as well as some iron and magnesium, (Mg, Fe)2 SiO4. Some minerals can be identified with little more than the naked eye. We do this by examining the physical properties of the mineral in question, which include: Color: the color of the mineral. Streak: the color of the minerals powder (this is often different from the color of the whole mineral). Luster: shininess.", "qID": "66048068223e4366952e302abf5a2ec0"}
{"question": "If a magnet is allowed to move freely, its north and south poles will always", "context": "A magnet is an object that attracts certain materials such as iron. Youre probably familiar with common bar magnets, like the one in Figure 24.2. Like all magnets, this bar magnet has north and south poles and attracts objects such as paper clips that contain iron. All magnets have two magnetic poles. The poles are regions where the magnet is strongest. (Earths axis is the imaginary line around which the planet rotates.) What do you suppose would happen if you cut the bar magnet in Figure 24.2 in half along the line between the north and south poles? Both halves would also have north and south poles. If you cut each of the halves in half, all those pieces would have north and south poles as well. Pieces of a magnet always have both north and south poles no matter how many times you cut the magnet. The force that a magnet exerts on certain materials is called magnetic force. Like electric force, magnetic force is exerted over a distance and includes forces of attraction and repulsion. North and south poles of two magnets attract each other, while two north poles or two south poles repel each other. Like the electric field that surrounds a charged particle, a magnetic field surrounds a magnet. This is the area around the magnet where it exerts magnetic force. Figure 24.3 shows the magnetic field surrounding a bar magnet. Tiny bits of iron, called iron filings, were placed under a sheet of glass. When the magnet was placed on the glass, it attracted the iron filings. The pattern of the iron filings shows the lines of force that make up the magnetic field of the magnet. The concentration of iron filings near the poles indicates that these areas exert the strongest force. To see an animated magnetic field of a bar magnet, go to this URL: http://elgg.norfolk.e2bn.org/jsmith112/files/68/149/ When two magnets are brought close together, their magnetic fields interact. You can see how in Figure 24.4. The drawings show how lines of force of north and south poles attract each other whereas those of two north poles repel each other. The animations at the URL below show how magnetic field lines change as two or more magnets move in relation to each other. You can take an animated quiz to check your understanding of magnetic field interactions at this URL: http://elgg. Magnetism is the ability of a material to be attracted by a magnet and to act as a magnet. No doubt youve handled refrigerator magnets like the ones in Figure 24.5. You probably know first-hand that they stick to a metal refrigerator but not to surfaces such as wooden doors and glass windows. Wood and glass arent attracted to a magnet, whereas the steel refrigerator is. Obviously, only certain materials respond to magnetic force. Magnetism is due to the movement of electrons within atoms of matter. When electrons spin around the nucleus of an atom, it causes the atom to become a tiny magnet, with north and south poles and a magnetic field. In most materials, the electrons orbiting the nuclei of the atoms are arranged in such a way that the materials have no magnetic properties. Also, in most types of matter, the north and south poles of atoms point in all different directions, so overall the matter is not magnetic. Examples of nonmagnetic materials include wood, glass, plastic, paper, copper, and aluminum. These materials are not attracted to magnets and cannot become magnets. In other materials, electrons fill the orbitals of the atoms that make up the material in a way to allow for each atom to have a tiny magnetic field, giving each atom a tiny north and south pole. There are large areas where the north and south poles of atoms are all lined up in the same direction. These areas are called magnetic domains. Generally, the magnetic domains point in different directions, so the material is still not magnetic. However, the material can be magnetized by placing it in a magnetic field. When this happens, all the magnetic domains become aligned, and the material becomes", "qID": "6f448298357d4f27a42194b4f157d27b"}
{"question": "type of property that can be measured or observed without matter changing to a different substance", "context": "Both you and the speck of dust consist of atoms of matter. So does the ground beneath your feet. In fact, everything you can see and touch is made of matter. The only things that aren't matter are forms of energy, such as light and sound. Although forms of energy are not matter, the air and other substances they travel through are. So what is matter? Matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume. Mass is the amount of matter in a substance or object. Mass is commonly measured with a balance. A simple mechanical balance is shown in Figure 3.1. It allows an object to be matched with other objects of known mass. SI units for mass are the kilogram, but for smaller masses grams are often used instead. The more matter an object contains, generally the more it weighs. However, weight is not the same thing as mass. Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling on an object. It is measured with a scale, like the kitchen-scale in Figure 3.2. The scale detects how forcefully objects in the pan are being pulled downward by the force of gravity. The SI unit for weight is the newton (N). The common English unit is the pound (lb). With Earth's gravity, a mass of 1 kg has a weight of 9.8 N (2.2 lb). Problem Solving Problem: At Earth's gravity, what is the weight in newtons of an object with a mass of 10 kg? Solution: At Earth's gravity, 1 kg has a weight of 9.8 N. Therefore, 10 kg has a weight of (10 * 9.8 N) = 98 N. You Try It! Problem: If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force, so mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes, even while the mass of the object remains constant. Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the moon, in Figure 3.3. An astronaut weighed less on the moon than he did on Earth because the moon's gravity is weaker than Earth's. The astronaut's mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. The amount of space matter takes up is its volume. How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of liquids is measured with measuring containers. In the kitchen, liquid volume is usually measured with measuring cups or spoons. In the lab, liquid volume is measured with containers such as graduated cylinders. Units in the metric system for liquid volume include liters (L) and milliliters (mL). The volume of gases depends on the volume of their container. That's because gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. For example, as you drink water from a bottle, air rushes in to take the place of the water. An 'empty' liter bottle actually holds a liter of air. How could you find the volume of air in an 'empty' room? The volume of regularly shaped solids can be calculated from their dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height (l * w * h). For solids that have irregular shapes, the displacement method is used to measure volume. You can see how it works in Figure 3.4 and in the video below. The SI unit for solid volumes is cubic meters (m3 ). However, cubic centimeters (cm3 ) are often used for smaller volume measurements.", "qID": "5196202df9dc407ca3d43bff5bc9452e"}

It forms a barrier between the cytoplasm and the environment outside the cell. The function of the cell membrane is to protect and support the cell. It also controls what enters or leaves the cell. It allows only certain substances to pass through. It keeps other substances inside or outside the cell.  The structure of the cell membrane explains how it can control what enters and leaves the cell. The membrane is composed mainly of two layers of phospholipids. Figure 3.8 shows how the phospholipids are arranged in the cell membrane. Each phospholipid molecule has a head and two tails. The heads are water loving (hydrophilic), and the tails are water fearing (hydrophobic). The water-loving heads are on the outer surfaces of the cell membrane. They point toward the watery cytoplasm within the cell or the watery fluid that surrounds the cell. The water-fearing tails are in the middle of the cell membrane.  Hydrophobic molecules like to be near other hydrophobic molecules. They fear being near hydrophilic molecules. The opposite is true of hydrophilic molecules. They like to be near other hydrophilic molecules. They fear being near hydrophobic molecules. These likes and fears explain why some molecules can pass through the cell membrane while others cannot. Hydrophobic molecules can pass through the cell membrane. Thats because they like the hydrophobic interior of the membrane and fear the hydrophilic exterior of the membrane. Hydrophilic molecules cant pass through the cell membrane. Thats because they like the hydrophilic exterior of the membrane and fear the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.

The water in the cytoplasm makes up about two-thirds of the cells weight. It gives the cell many of its properties.  Why does a cell have cytoplasm? Cytoplasm has several important functions. These include: suspending cell organelles. pushing against the cell membrane to help the cell keep its shape. providing a site for many of the biochemical reactions of the cell.  Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and several other types of organelles. These structures carry out many vital cell functions.  The nucleus is the largest organelle in a eukaryotic cell. It contains most of the cells DNA. DNA, in turn, contains the genetic code. This code tells the cell which proteins to make and when to make them. You can see a diagram of a cell nucleus in Figure 3.10. Besides DNA, the nucleus contains a structure called a nucleolus. Its function is to form ribosomes. The membrane enclosing the nucleus is called the nuclear envelope. The envelope has tiny holes, or pores, in it. The pores allow substances to move into and out of the nucleus.  The mitochondrion (mitochondria, plural) is an organelle that makes energy available to the cell. Its like the power plant of a cell. It uses energy in glucose to make smaller molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP packages energy in smaller amounts that cells can use.

Scales are overlapping tissues, like shingles on a roof. They reduce friction with the water. They also provide a flexible covering that lets fish move their body to swim. Fish have gills. Gills are organs behind the head that absorb oxygen from water. Water enters through the mouth, passes over the gills, and then exits the body. Fish typically have a stream-lined body. This reduces water resistance. Most fish have fins. Fins function like paddles or rudders. They help fish swim and navigate in the water. Most fish have a swim bladder. This is a balloon-like organ containing gas. By inflating or deflating their swim bladder, fish can rise or sink in the water.  Fish have a circulatory system with a heart. They also have a complete digestive system. It includes several organs and other structures. Fish with jaws use their jaws and teeth to chew food before swallowing it. This allows them to eat larger prey animals. Fish have a nervous system with a brain. Fish brains are small compared with the brains of other vertebrates. However, they are large and complex compared with the brains of invertebrates. Fish also have highly developed sense organs. They include organs to see, hear, feel, smell, and taste.  Almost all fish have sexual reproduction, generally with separate sexes. Each fish typically produces large numbers of sperm or eggs. Fertilization takes place in the water outside the body in the majority of fish. Most fish are oviparous. The embryo develops in an egg outside the mothers body.  Many species of fish reproduce by spawning. Spawning occurs when many adult fish group together and release their sperm or eggs into the water at the same time. You can see fish spawning in Figure 13.8. Spawning increases the changes that fertilization will take place. It typically results in a large number of embryos forming at once.

{"question": "__part of a biogeochemical cycle that holds a substance for a short period of time", "context": "The chemical elements and water that are needed by living things keep recycling on Earth. They pass back and forth through biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. Thats why their cycles are called biogeochemical cycles. For example, a chemical element or water might move from organisms (bio) to the atmosphere or ocean (geo) and back to organisms again. Elements or water may be held for various periods of time in different parts of a biogeochemical cycle. For example, the atmosphere usually holds water (as water vapor) for just a few days. A reservoir is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a long period of time. For example, the ocean is a reservoir for water. It may hold water for thousands of years. The rest of this lesson describes three biogeochemical cycles: water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Water is an extremely important aspect of every ecosystem. Life cant exist without water. Most organisms contain a large amount of water, and many live in water. Therefore, the water cycle is essential to life on Earth. Water on Earth is billions of years old. However, individual water molecules keep moving through the water cycle. The water cycle is a global cycle. It takes place on, above, and below Earths surface, as shown in Figure 24.7. During the water cycle, water occurs in three different states: gas (water vapor), liquid (water), and solid (ice). Many processes are involved as water changes state to move through the cycle. Watch this video for an excellent visual introduction to the water cycle: . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: Water changes to a gas by three different processes called evaporation, sublimation, and transpiration. Evaporation takes place when water on Earths surface changes to water vapor. The sun heats the water and gives water molecules enough energy to escape into the atmosphere. Most evaporation occurs from the surface of the ocean. Sublimation takes place when snow and ice on Earths surface change directly to water vapor without first melting to form liquid water. This also happens because of heat from the sun. Transpiration takes place when plants release water vapor through pores in their leaves called stomata. Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation. Precipitation is any form of water that falls from the atmosphere. It includes rain, snow, sleet, hail, and freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or even longer. Condensation may also form fog or dew. Some living things, like the lizard in Figure 24.8, depend directly on these sources of liquid water. Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface of the ground. This water is called runoff. It may eventually flow into a body of water. Some precipitation that falls on land soaks into the ground. This water becomes groundwater. Groundwater may seep out of the ground at a spring or into a body of water such as the ocean. Some groundwater is taken up by plant roots. Some may flow deeper underground to an aquifer. An aquifer is an underground layer of rock that stores water. Water may be stored in an aquifer for thousands of years. The element carbon is the basis of all life on Earth. Biochemical compounds consist of chains of carbon atoms and just a few other elements. Like water, carbon is constantly recycled through the biotic and abiotic factors of ecosystems.

Fins of bony fish: ray fin (left) and lobe fin (right). Most fish are bony fish, making them the largest group of vertebrates in existence today. They are characterized by: 1. A head and pectoral girdles that are covered with bones derived from the skin. 2. A lung or swim bladder, which helps control their depth. 3. Jointed, segmented rods supporting the fins. 4.

By comparison, there are about 10,000 species of birds. The ray-finned fish have fin rays supported by bony spines known as rays. They live in all aquatic environments, from freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams. Lobe-finned fish are characterized by fleshy lobed fins, as opposed to the bony fins of the ray-finned fish. These fins evolved into legs of amphibians, the first tetrapod land vertebrates.

{"question": "The prefix nimbo- means", "context": "What do temperature, clouds, winds, and rain have in common? They are all part of weather. Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere at a given time and place. Weather occurs because of unequal heating of the atmosphere. The source of heat is the Sun. The general principles behind weather can be stated simply: The Sun heats Earth's surface more in some places than others. Where it is warm, heat from the Sun warms the air close to the surface. If there is water at the surface, it may cause some of the water to evaporate. Warm air is less dense, so it rises. When this happens, more dense air flows in to take its place. The flowing surface air is wind. The rising air cools as it goes higher in the atmosphere. If it is moist, the water vapor may condense. Clouds may form, and precipitation may fall. The water cycle plays an important role in weather. When liquid water evaporates, it causes humidity. When water vapor condenses, it forms clouds and precipitation. Humidity, clouds, and precipitation are all important weather factors. Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation. Humidity usually refers to relative humidity. This is the percent of water vapor in the air relative to the total amount the air can hold. How much water vapor can the air hold? That depends on temperature. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air. You can see this in Figure 16.1. People often say, its not the heat but the humidity. Humidity can make a hot day feel even hotter. When sweat evaporates, it cools your body. But sweat can't evaporate when the air already contains as much water vapor as it can hold. The heat index is a measure of what the temperature feels like because of the humidity. You can see the heat index in Figure 16.2. You've probably noticed dew on the grass on a summer morning. Why does dew form? Remember that the land heats up and cools down fairly readily. So when night comes, the land cools. Air that was warm and humid in the daytime also cools overnight. As the air cools, it can hold less water vapor. Some of the water vapor condenses on the cool surfaces, such as blades of grass. The temperature at which water vapor condenses is called the dew point. If this temperature is below freezing, ice crystals of frost form instead of dew. As you can see in Figure 16.1, the dew point occurs at 100 percent relative humidity. Can you explain why? Clouds form when air in the atmosphere reaches the dew point. Clouds may form anywhere in the troposphere. Clouds that form on the ground are called fog. Clouds form when water vapor condenses around particles in the air. The particles are specks of matter, such as dust or smoke. Billions of these tiny water droplets come together to make up a cloud. If the air is very cold, ice crystals form instead of liquid water. Clouds are classified on the basis of where and how they form. Three main types of clouds are cirrus, stratus, and cumulus. Figure 16.3 shows these and other types of clouds. Cirrus clouds form high in the troposphere. Because it is so cold they are made of ice crystals. They are thin and wispy. Cirrus clouds don't usually produce precipitation, but they may be a sign that wet weather is coming. Stratus clouds occur low in the troposphere. They form in layers that spread horizontally and may cover the entire sky like a thick blanket. Cumulus clouds are white and puffy. Convection currents make them grow upward and they may grow very tall. Clouds can affect the temperature on Earth's surface. During the day, thick clouds block some of the Sun's rays.

{"question": "total kinetic energy of particles of matter", "context": "No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might define it as how hot or cold something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles in an object. When particles move more quickly, temperature is higher and an object feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, temperature is lower and an object feels cooler. Temperature affects thermal energy, but temperature isn't the same thing as thermal energy. That's because an object's mass also affects its thermal energy. The examples in Figure 18.1 make this clear. In the figure, the particles of cocoa are moving faster than the particles of bathwater. Therefore, the cocoa has a higher temperature. However, the bath water has more thermal energy because there is so much more of it. It has many more moving particles.

URL:  If you're still not clear about the relationship between temperature and thermal energy, watch the animation 'Temperature' at this URL:  . Temperature is measured with a thermometer. A thermometer shows how hot or cold something is relative to two reference temperatures, usually the freezing and boiling points of water. Scientists often use the Celsius scale for temperature. On this scale, the freezing point of water is 0C and the boiling point is 100C. To learn more about measuring temperature, watch the animation Measuring Temperature at this URL:  Did you ever wonder how a thermometer works? Look at the thermometer in Figure 18.2. Particles of the red liquid have greater energy when they are warmer, so they move more and spread apart. This causes the liquid to expand and rise higher in the glass tube. Like the liquid in a thermometer, most types of matter expand to some degree when they get warmer. Gases usually expand the most when heated, followed by liquids. Solids generally expand the least. (Water is an exception; it takes up more space as a solid than as a liquid.)  Something that has a high temperature is said to be hot. Does temperature measure heat? Is heat just another word for thermal energy? The answer to both questions is no. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between objects that have different temperatures. Thermal energy always moves from an object with a higher temperature to an object with a lower temperature. When thermal energy is transferred in this way, the warm object becomes cooler and the cool object becomes warmer. Sooner or later, both objects will have the same temperature. Only then does the transfer of thermal energy end. For a visual explanation of these concepts, watch the animation 'Temperature vs. Heat' at this URL:  .  Figure 18.3 illustrates an example of thermal energy transfer. Before the spoon was put into the steaming hot coffee, it was cool to the touch. Once in the coffee, the spoon heated up quickly. The fast-moving particles of the coffee transferred some of their energy to the slower-moving particles of the spoon. The spoon particles started moving faster and became warmer, causing the temperature of the spoon to rise. Because the coffee particles lost some of their kinetic energy to the spoon particles, the coffee particles started to move more slowly. This caused the temperature of the coffee to fall. Before long, the coffee and spoon had the same temperature. The girls in Figure 18.4 are having fun at the beach. Its a warm, sunny day, and the sand feels hot under their bare hands and feet. The water, in contrast, feels much cooler. Why does the sand get so hot while the water does not? The answer has to do with specific heat. Specific heat is the amount of energy (in joules) needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1C. Specific heat is a property that is specific to a given type of matter.

The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation. Only unstable nuclei emit radiation. When they do, they gain or lose protons. Then the atoms become different elements. (Be careful not to confuse this radiation with electromagnetic radiation, which has to do with the light given off by atoms as they absorb and then emit energy.)  Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by a French physicist named Antoine Henri Becquerel. Becquerel was experimenting with uranium, which glows after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel wanted to see if the glow was caused by rays of energy, like rays of light and X-rays. He placed a bit of uranium on a photographic plate. The plate was similar to film thats used today to take X-rays. You can see an example of an X-ray in Figure 11.1. As Becquerel predicted, the uranium left an image on the photographic plate. This meant that uranium gives off rays after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel was a good scientist, so he wanted to repeat his experiment to confirm his results. He placed more uranium on another photographic plate. However, the day had turned cloudy, so he tucked the plate and uranium in a drawer to try again another day.

Many elements have one or more isotopes that are radioactive. Radioactive isotopes are called radioisotopes. An example of a radioisotope is carbon-14.

In elements with more than 83 protons, all the isotopes are radioactive (see Figure 11.2). The force of repulsion among all those protons overcomes the strong force holding them together.

{"question": "What does a properly operating nuclear power plant release into the air?", "context": "Fossil fuels are made from plants and animals that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. The plants and animals died. Their remains settled onto the ground and at the bottom of the sea. Layer upon layer of organic material was laid down. Eventually, the layers were buried very deeply. They experienced intense heat and pressure. Over millions of years, the organic material turned into fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are compounds of carbon and hydrogen, called hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons can be solid, liquid, or gas. The solid form is coal. The liquid form is petroleum, or crude oil. The gaseous form is natural gas. Coal is a solid hydrocarbon. Coal is useful as a fuel, especially for generating electricity. Coal forms from dead plants that settled at the bottom of swamps millions of years ago. Water and mud in the swamp kept oxygen away from the plant material. Sand and clay settled on top of the decaying plants. The weight of this material squeezed out the water and some other substances. Over time, the organic material became a carbon-rich rock. This rock is coal. Coal is a black or brownish-black rock that burns easily (Figure 5.3). Most coal is sedimentary rock. The hardest type of coal, anthracite, is a metamorphic rock. That is because it is exposed to higher temperature and pressure as it forms. Coal is mostly carbon, but some other elements can be found in coal, including sulfur. Around the world, coal is the largest source of energy for electricity. The United States is rich in coal. Pennsylvania and the region to the west of the Appalachian Mountains are some of the most coal-rich areas of the United States. Coal has to be mined to get it out of the ground. Coal mining affects the environment and human health. Coal mining can take place underground or at the surface. Each method has some advantages and disadvantages. Surface mining exposes minerals that were underground to air and water at the surface. These minerals contain the chemical element sulfur. Sulfur mixes with air and water to make sulfuric acid. This acid is a highly corrosive chemical. Sulfuric acid gets into nearby streams and can kill fish, plants, and animals. Surface mining is safer for the miners. Coal mining underground is dangerous for the coal miners. Miners are sometimes killed if there is an explosion or a mine collapse. Miners breathe in coal dust and can get terrible lung diseases after a number of years in the mines. To prepare coal for use, the coal is first crushed into powder and burned in a furnace. Like other fuels, coal releases most of its energy as heat when it burns. The heat from the burning coal is used to boil water. This makes steam. The steam spins turbines, which creates electricity. Oil is a thick, dark brown or black liquid. It is found in rock layers of the Earths crust. Oil is currently the most commonly used source of energy in the world. The way oil forms is similar in many ways to coal. Tiny organisms like plankton and algae die and settle to the bottom of the sea. Sediments settle over the organic material. Oxygen is kept away by the sediments. When the material is buried deep enough, it is exposed to high heat and pressure. Over millions of years, the organic material transforms into liquid oil. The United States produces only about one-quarter as much oil as it uses. The main oil producing regions in the U.S. are the Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Alaska, and California. Geologists look for oil in folded layers of rock called anticlines. Oil moves through permeable rock and is trapped by the impermeable cap rock. Oil comes out of the ground as crude oil. Crude oil is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons. Oil is separated into different compounds at an oil refinery (Figure 5.4). This is done by heating the oil. Each hydrocarbon compound in crude oil boils at a different temperature. We get gasoline, diesel, and heating oil, plus waxes, plastics, and fertilizers from crude oil.

{"question": "energy released when atomic nuclei split apart", "context": "Energy, or the ability to do work, can exist in many different forms. The photo in Figure 17.8 represents six of the eight different forms of energy that are described in this lesson. The guitarist gets the energy he needs to perform from chemical energy in food. He uses mechanical energy to pluck the strings of the guitar. The stage lights use electrical energy and give off both light energy and thermal energy, commonly called heat. The guitar also uses electrical energy, and it produces sound energy when the guitarist plucks the strings. For an introduction to all these forms of energy, go to this URL:  . For an interactive animation about the different forms of energy, visit this URL:  After you read below about different forms of energy, you can check your knowledge by doing the drag and drop quiz at this URL:  .  Mechanical energy is the energy of an object that is moving or has the potential to move. It is the sum of an objects kinetic and potential energy. In Figure 17.9, the basketball has mechanical energy because it is moving. The arrow in the same figure has mechanical energy because it has the potential to move due to the elasticity of the bow. What are some other examples of mechanical energy?  Energy is stored in the bonds between atoms that make up compounds. This energy is called chemical energy, and it is a form of potential energy. If the bonds between atoms are broken, the energy is released and can do work. The wood in the fireplace in Figure 17.10 has chemical energy. The energy is released as thermal energy when the wood burns. People and many other living things meet their energy needs with chemical energy stored in food. When food molecules are broken down, the energy is released and may be used to do work.  Electrons are negatively charged particles in atoms. Moving electrons have a form of kinetic energy called electrical energy. If youve ever experienced an electric outage, then you know how hard it is to get by without electrical energy. Most of the electrical energy we use is produced by power plants and arrives in our homes through wires. Two other sources of electrical energy are pictured in Figure 17.11. The atoms that make up matter are in constant motion, so they have kinetic energy. All that motion gives matter thermal energy. Thermal energy is defined as the total kinetic energy of all the atoms that make up an object. It depends on how fast the atoms are moving and how many atoms the object has. Therefore, an object with more mass has greater thermal energy than an object with less mass, even if their individual atoms are moving at the same speed. You can see an example of this in Figure 17.13.  Energy that the sun and other stars release into space is called electromagnetic energy. This form of energy travels through space as electrical and magnetic waves. Electromagnetic energy is commonly called light. It includes visible light, as well as radio waves, microwaves, and X rays (Figure 17.14).  The drummer in Figure 17.15 is hitting the drumheads with drumsticks. This causes the drumheads to vibrate. The vibrations pass to surrounding air particles and then from one air particle to another in a wave of energy called sound energy. We hear sound when the sound waves reach our ears. Sound energy can travel through air, water, and other substances, but not through empty space. Thats because the energy needs particles of matter to pass it on. Energy often changes from one form to another. For example, the mechanical energy of a moving drumstick changes to sound energy when it strikes the drumhead and causes it to vibrate.

{"question": "__biogeochemical cycle that includes sedimentary rocks and fossil fuels", "context": "The chemical elements and water that are needed by living things keep recycling on Earth. They pass back and forth through biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. Thats why their cycles are called biogeochemical cycles. For example, a chemical element or water might move from organisms (bio) to the atmosphere or ocean (geo) and back to organisms again. Elements or water may be held for various periods of time in different parts of a biogeochemical cycle. An exchange pool is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a short period of time. For example, the atmosphere is an exchange pool for water. It usually holds water (as water vapor) for just a few days. A reservoir is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a long period of time. For example, the ocean is a reservoir for water. It may hold water for thousands of years. The rest of this lesson describes three biogeochemical cycles: water cycle, nitrogen cycle, and phosphorus cycle. Water is an extremely important aspect of every ecosystem. Life cant exist without water. Most organisms contain a large amount of water, and many live in water. Therefore, the water cycle is essential to life on Earth. Water on Earth is billions of years old. However, individual water molecules keep moving through the water cycle. The water cycle is a global cycle. It takes place on, above, and below Earths surface, as shown in Figure 24.7. During the water cycle, water occurs in three different states: gas (water vapor), liquid (water), and solid (ice). Many processes are involved as water changes state to move through the cycle. Watch this video for an excellent visual introduction to the water cycle:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Water changes to a gas by three different processes called evaporation, sublimation, and transpiration. Evaporation takes place when water on Earths surface changes to water vapor. The sun heats the water and gives water molecules enough energy to escape into the atmosphere. Most evaporation occurs from the surface of the ocean. Sublimation takes place when snow and ice on Earths surface change directly to water vapor without first melting to form liquid water. This also happens because of heat from the sun. Transpiration takes place when plants release water vapor through pores in their leaves called stomata.  Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation. Precipitation is any form of water that falls from the atmosphere. It includes rain, snow, sleet, hail, and freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or even longer. Condensation may also form fog or dew. Some living things, like the lizard in Figure 24.8, depend directly on these sources of liquid water.  Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface of the ground. This water is called runoff. It may eventually flow into a body of water. Some precipitation that falls on land soaks into the ground. This water becomes groundwater. Groundwater may seep out of the ground at a spring or into a body of water such as the ocean. Some groundwater is taken up by plant roots. Some may flow deeper underground to an aquifer. An aquifer is an underground layer of rock that stores water. Water may be stored in an aquifer for thousands of years.", "qID": "a3bcbf5d04984ec090d4f37446b2d23e"}
{"question": "type of seismic wave that cannot travel through Earths liquid outer core", "context": "Seismic waves are measured on a seismograph. Seismographs contain a lot of information, and not just about earthquakes. A seismograph is a machine that records seismic waves. In the past, seismographs produced a seismogram. A seismogram is a paper record of the seismic waves the seismograph received. Seismographs have a weighted pen suspended from a stationary frame. A drum of paper is attached to the ground. As the ground shakes in an earthquake, the pen remains stationary but the drum moves beneath it. This creates the squiggly lines that make up a seismogram (Figure 7.33). Modern seismographs record ground motions using electronic motion detectors. The data are recorded digitally on a computer. Seismograms contain a lot of information about an earthquake: its strength, length and distance. Wave height used to determine the magnitude of the earthquake. The seismogram shows the different arrival times of the seismic waves (Figure 7.34). If a seismogram may record P-waves and surface waves, but not certain other waves, this might indicate that the earthquake was distant. One seismogram indicates the distance to the epicenter. This is determined by the P-and S-wave arrival times. If a quake is near the seismograph, the S-waves arrive shortly after the P-waves. If a quake is far from the seismograph, the P-waves arrive long before the S-waves. The longer the time is between the P-and S-wave arrivals, the further away the earthquake was from the seismograph. First, seismologists calculate the arrival time difference. Then they know the distance to the epicenter from that seismograph. Next, the seismologists try to determine the location of the earthquake epicenter. To do this they need the distances to the epicenter from at least three seismographs. Lets say that they know that an earthquake's epicenter is 50 kilometers from Kansas City. They draw a circle with a 50 km radius around that seismic station. They do this twice more around two different seismic stations. The three circles intersect at a single point. This is the earthquake's epicenter (Figure 7.35). The ways seismologists measure an earthquake have changed over the decades. Initially, they could only measure what people felt and saw, the intensity. Now they can measure the energy released during the quake, the magnitude. Early in the 20th century, earthquakes were described in terms of what people felt and the damage that was done to buildings. The Mercalli Intensity Scale describes earthquake intensity. There are many problems with the Mercalli scale. The damage from an earthquake is affected by many things. Different people experience an earthquake differently. Using this scale, comparisons between earthquakes were difficult to make. A new scale was needed. Charles Richter developed the Richter magnitude scale in 1935. The Richter scale measures the magnitude of an earthquake's largest jolt of energy. This is determined by using the height of the waves recorded on a seismograph. Richter scale magnitudes jump from one level to the next. The height of the largest wave increases 10 times with each level. So the height of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake is 10 times that of a magnitude 4 quake. A magnitude 5 is 100 times that of a magnitude 3 quake. With each level, thirty times more energy is released. A difference of two levels on the Richter scale equals 900 times more released energy. The Richter scale has limitations. A single sharp jolt measures higher on the Richter scale than a very long intense earthquake. Yet this is misleading because the longer quake releases more energy. Earthquakes that release more energy are likely to do more damage. As a result, another scale was needed. The moment magnitude scale is the favored method of measuring earthquake magnitudes.

Eruptions also take place through other types of vents, commonly from fissures (Figure 1.1). The eruptions that created the entire ocean floor are essentially fissure eruptions. Viscous lava flows slowly. If there is not enough magma or enough pressure to create an explosive eruption, the magma may form a lava dome. Because it is so thick, the lava does not flow far from the vent. (Figure 1.2). Lava flows often make mounds right in the middle of craters at the top of volcanoes, as seen in the Figure 1.3. A fissure eruption on Mauna Loa in Hawaii travels toward Mauna Kea on the Big Island. Lava domes are large, round landforms created by thick lava that does not travel far from the vent. Lava domes may form in the crater of composite volcanoes as at Mount St. Helens. A lava plateau forms when large amounts of fluid lava flow over an extensive area (Figure 1.4). When the lava solidifies, it creates a large, flat surface of igneous rock. Layer upon layer of basalt have created the Columbia Plateau, which covers more than 161,000 square kilometers (63,000 square miles) in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Lava creates new land as it solidifies on the coast or emerges from beneath the water (Figure 1.5). Lava flowing into the sea creates new land in Hawaii.

{"question": "turning out heat", "context": "In an endothermic reaction, it takes more energy to break bonds in the reactants than is released when new bonds form in the products. The word 'endothermic' literally means 'taking in heat.' A constant input of energy, often in the form of heat, is needed in an endothermic reaction. Not enough energy is released when products form to break more bonds in the reactants. Additional energy is needed to keep the reaction going. The general equation for an endothermic reaction is: Reactants + Energy ! Products In many endothermic reactions, heat is absorbed from the surroundings. As a result, the temperature drops. The drop in temperature may be great enough to cause liquid products to freeze. Thats what happens in the endothermic reaction at this URL:  One of the most important endothermic reactions is photosynthesis. In this reaction, plants synthesize glucose (C6 H12 O6 ) from carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and water (H2 O). They also release oxygen (O2 ). The energy for photo- synthesis comes from light (see Figure 8.12). Without light energy, photosynthesis cannot occur. The chemical equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2 O ! C6 H12 O6 + 6O2  Whether a reaction absorbs energy or releases energy, there is no overall change in the amount of energy. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. This is the law of conservation of energy. Energy can change form for example, from electricity to light but the same amount of energy always remains. If energy cannot be destroyed, what happens to the energy that is absorbed in an endothermic reaction? The energy is stored in the chemical bonds of the products. This form of energy is called chemical energy. All chemical reactions, even those that absorb a large amount of energy, need a certain amount of energy to get started. This energy is called activation energy. For example, activation energy is needed to start a car. Turning the key causes a spark that activates the burning of gasoline in the engine. The combustion of gas wont occur without the spark of energy to begin the reaction. Why is activation energy needed? A reaction wont occur unless atoms or molecules of reactants come together. This happens only if the particles are moving, and movement takes energy. Often, reactants have to overcome forces that push them apart. This takes energy as well. Still more energy is needed to start breaking bonds in reactants. You have probably used activation energy to start a chemical reaction. For example, if youve ever used a match to light a campfire, then you provided the activation energy needed to start a combustion reaction.", "qID": "8cfca55fc9d544de9ccb8c4859ebf098"}

MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  For a long time, scientists classified fungi as members of the Plant Kingdom. Fungi share several obvious traits with plants. For example, both fungi and plants lack the ability to move. Both grow in soil, and both have cell walls. Some fungi even look like plants.  Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have important traits that set them apart from plants. Thats why they are placed in their own kingdom. The Fungus Kingdom is large and diverse. It may contain more than a million species. However, fewer than 100,000 species of fungi have been identified.  The earliest fungi evolved about 600 million years ago. They lived in the water. Fungi colonized the land around the same time as plants. That was probably between 400 and 500 million years ago. After that, fungi became very abundant on land. By 250 million years ago, they may have been the dominant life forms on land.  Yeasts grow as single cells. Other fungi grow into multicellular, thread-like structures. These structures are called hyphae (hypha, singular). You can see a photo of hyphae in Figure 9.8. They resemble plant roots. Each hypha consists of a group of cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. A mass of hyphae make up the body of a fungus. The body is called the mycelium (mycelia, plural). A mycelium may range in size from microscopic to very large. In fact, the largest living thing on Earth is the mycelium of a single fungus. Nicknamed the humongous fungus, it grows in a forest in Oregon. A small part of the fungus is pictured in Figure 9.9. The giant fungus covers an area of 2384 acres. Thats about the size of 1,665 football fields! The fungus is estimated to be at least 2400 years old, but it could be much older.  Most fungi reproduce both asexually and sexually. In both types of reproduction, they produce spores. A spore is a special reproductive cell. When fungi reproduce asexually, they can spread quickly. This is good when conditions are stable. They can increase their genetic variation by sexual reproduction. This is beneficial when conditions are changing. Variation helps ensure that at least some organisms survive the changing conditions. Figure 9.10 shows how asexual and sexual reproduction occur in fungi. Refer to the figure as you read about each of them below.  During asexual reproduction, fungi produce haploid spores by mitosis of a haploid parent cell. A haploid cell has just one of each pair of chromosomes. The haploid spores are genetically identical to the parent cell. Spores may be spread by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Wherever the spores land, they will develop into new hyphae only when conditions are suitable for growth. Yeasts are an exception. They reproduce asexually by budding instead of by producing spores. An offspring cell forms on a parent cell. After it grows and develops, it buds off to form a new cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. You can see yeast cells budding in Figure 9.11.  Sexual reproduction also occurs in most fungi. It happens when two haploid hyphae mate. During mating, two haploid parent cells fuse.

Generally speaking, gestures are a type of communication that uses a part of our body, and when speaking with people from other cultures, gestures can be important keys or clues to understand them. However, we need to understand that those gestures vary from culture to culture, and it is necessary for us to have an open mind in understanding the different gestures.", "qID": "f4452ec14342456d8f311d0d08e9f74a"}
{"question": "Recorded history has taught us", "context": "In a few states where racial prejudice is serious, violence has so come to be taken for granted as a means of solving differences, that it is not even questioned. There are states where the white man imposes his rule by force; there are states where the black man protests by setting fire to cities and by looting and pillaging. Important people on both sides, who would in other respects appear to be reasonable men, get up and calmly argue in favor of violence - as if it were a legitimate solution, like any other. What is really frightening, what really fills you with despair, is the realization that when it comes to the crunch, we have made no actual progress at all. We may wear collars and ties instead of war-paint, but our instincts remain basically unchanged. The sheer horror, the bloodshed, the suffering mean nothing. No solution ever comes to light the morning after when we dismally contemplate the smoking ruins and wonder what hit us. The truly reasonable men who know where the solutions lie are finding it harder and harder to get a hearing. They are despised, mistrusted and even persecuted by their own kind because they advocate such apparently outrageous things as law enforcement. If half the energy that goes into violent acts were put to good use, if our efforts were directed at cleaning up the shabby houses at improving living-standards and providing education and employment for all, we would have gone a long way to arriving at a solution. Our strength is weakened by having to mop up the mess that violence leaves in its wake. In a well-directed effort, it would not be impossible to fulfill the ideals of a stable social programme. The benefits that can be derived from constructive solutions are everywhere apparent in the world around us. Genuine and lasting solutions are always possible, providing we work within the framework of the law. Before we can even begin to reflect on peaceful co-existence between the races, we must appreciate each other's problems. And to do this, we must learn about them: it is a simple exercise in communication, in exchanging information. \"Talk, talk, talk,\" the advocates of violence say, \"all you ever do is talk, and we are none the wiser.\" It's rather like the story of the famous lawyer who carefully explained his case to the judge. After listening to a lengthy argument the judge complained that after all this talk, he was none the wiser. \"Possible, my lord,\" the lawyer replied, \"none the wiser, but surely far better informed.\" Knowledge is the necessary prerequisite to wisdom: the knowledge that violence creates the evils it pretends to solve.", "qID": "3372b6a3133549f4af5df9b725757e8e"}
{"question": "What is the percentage of Spanish men who don't do any housework?", "context": "Spanish men will have to learn to change diapers and do dishwashing under the terms of a new law designed to strike a blow. The law, due to be passed this month, is likely to cause a revolution in family affairs. It will oblige men to \"share domestic responsibilities and the care and attention\" of children and elderly family members, according to the draft approved by the Spanish parliament's justice commission. \"This will be a good way of reminding people what their duties are. It is something feminists have been wanting for a long time,\" said Margarita Uria, of the Basque Nationalist Party, who was behind what is an amendment to a new divorce law. Failure to meet the obligations will be taken into consideration by judges when determining the terms of divorces. Men who refuse to do their part may be given less frequent contact with their children. Spanish women spend five times longer on housework than husbands. Even when both have jobs outside the home, Spanish women still do three times as much work in the house. \"It is not just about housework, though,\" said Ms. Uria. A study five years ago by Spain's Center for Sociological Investigation concluded that fathers spent an average of 13 minutes each day looking after their children. Only 19 % of Spanish men thought it was right for mothers of school-age children to have a full-time job. More than a third thought mothers should not work outside the home at all. The Change to the Spanish legal code will see domestic obligations added to a list of marital duties that currently includes fidelity, living together and helping one another. That should guarantee that, when the law--which will also make divorce proceedings faster and easier--is voted on in parliament in the next few weeks, the obligation to share domestic chores will be added to the statute books.", "qID": "ea6703740fee4489999767c8f0c8c77e"}
{"question": "Who might block the development of Brazil?", "context": "Brazil is a federation that consists of twenty-six states and one federal district. The biggest majority of Brazil's population belongs to the Christian religion and almost all of them are Catholics. This is something Brazil inherited being Portugal's colony . Historically, the country was a colony claimed by people from Portugal and this made Portuguese the official language. The Portuguese reached Brazil in 1500 and until that moment it was inhabited by semi-nomadic people. The Portuguese changed Brazil into a country of slaves until 1800, when Maria I of Portugal came to live in Brazil. The Queen did not stay long in Brazil, but during the 20 years of royal presence a lot of changes occurred: commercial ports to United Kingdom were opened; Brazil stopped being isolated from other countries. So at the moment of getting the independence on the 7th of September, 1822, Brazil already had the potential to develop. The Brazilian Empire, Pedro I, abolished slavery in 1888 in the face of Princess Isabel. A lot of European people started coming to Brazil and the industry of the country started working. In the 19th and the 20th century as it has been said above foreign people immigrated to Brazil and basically 5 million European and Japanese people became the residents of Brazil. The beginning of the 20th century was especially marked by the immigration of a lot of Asian people: Japanese, Korean and Chinese immigrants. As a matter of fact Japanese people do not immigrate a lot, and the fact that the Brazilian-Japanese people are the largest Japanese minority in the world does astonish greatly. The majority of the cultural inherits of Brazil are actually Portuguese, due to the fact that Brazil was Portugal's colony for a very long time. The southern states mainly consist of European population and the north and the northeast consist of a mixed population including Africans, Amerindians and Europeans. Most of this population is Roman Catholic. No other country in the world has the same amount of Catholics. The modern tendency of Brazil is the growing number of people calling themselves Protestants. Around 7.4% of the population don't believe any god. Some Brazilians, especially in the northern states are mixed Africans who prefer following the traditional African religions. Only 1.8% of the population chose Buddhism, Islam or Judaism.", "qID": "3b4008834c604611923ef1e37ecaf8b4"}

The clear message broadcast by all responsible governments is that every person has a part to play. Here are some detailed instructions. 1. Prevent pollution by disposing of all your litter and waste in the correct, legal way, such as using on-street waste receptacles when you are out and about, or putting it in your domestic rubbish can when you're at home. Follow local procedures for normal waste disposal. 2. Recycle all materials that can be processed by your local authority. Place plastics, metals, paper and glass in the correct collection receptacles. Donate unwanted items to the charities that are happy to accept good condition clothing, furniture and even automobiles. 3. Look after reserves of water by making sure you turn off the tap after use and by repairing leaks and drips. Purchase water-efficient appliances. Take showers instead of baths. Gather rainwater for garden use and use your lawn sprinkler less often or not at all. 4. Save energy by choosing Energy Star products. Turn these off, as well as lights, when you don't need them to be on. Use air condition and heating less often. Make sure your home is insulated correctly to maintain a steady temperature. 5. Reduce the amount of the material you use. Print emails occasionally or not at all rather than printing them every time. You buy new things when you actually need them rather than on a whim.

{"question": "How deep have we gone into the earth until now?", "context": "An annoying problem for humans, who like to boast about all the distant planets and moons we have explored, is that we've never taken a good look right under our noses. The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there? The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). The Mohole project, a U.S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle. Sadly the project involved government supporting. It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust --- about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible. What little we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes. So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack. Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out data to the surface. Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. \"We're going somewhere we haven't been before,\" he says. \"In all possibility, there will be surprises.\" This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked with Isn't Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt pretty much anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new look at an old problem. Great things can come from what seems like impossible ideas.", "qID": "e10de2e233404c819d31900b3637dda1"}

{"question": "In the opinion of the writer,women encourage men to talk more because    .", "context": "According to the latest research in the United States, men and women talk such different languages that it is like people from two different cultures trying to communicate. Professor Deborah Tannen of Georgetown University has noticed the difference in the style of boys' and girls' conversations from an early age. She says that little girls' conversation is less definite than boys' and expresses more doubts. Little boys use conversations to establish status with their listeners. These differences continue into adult life, she says. In public conversations, men talk most and interrupt other speakers more. In private conversations, men and women speak in equal amounts--although they say things in a different style. Professor Tannen believes that, for women, private talking is a way to establish and test intimacy. For men, private talking is a way to explore the power structure of a relationship. Teaching is one job where the differences between men's and women's ways of talking show. When a man teaches a woman, says Professor Tannen, he wants to show that he has more knowledge, and hence more power in conversation. When a woman teaches another woman, however, she is more likely to take a sharing approach and to encourage her student to join in. But Professor Tannen does not believe that women are naturally more helpful. Some scientists who are studying speech think that the brain is pre-programmed for language. As we are usually taught to speak by women, it seems that the brain must have a sexual bias in its programming, otherwise male speech patterns would not arise at all.", "qID": "e8d78fcfa36e409b820cc7e9460c3729"}

{"question": "Which one of the following is NOT one of the reasons why officials from the university are reluctant to give interviews?", "context": "It's a nightmare for Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST): within a week, two students committed suicide by jumping off dorm buildings. Officials from the university are reluctant to give interviews. \"We had a hard time calming down students who were shocked at the suicides,\" said Zhang Jingyuan, head of HUST's center for research and guidance for students' development. \"Media coverage may arouse some students' negative emotions again. Suicide can be contagious,\" Zhang said. Advisors and class leaders conducted dorm-to-dorm checks to find students suffering depression. Then psychologists offered one-on-one counseling to them. Notice boards publicizing tips for identifying peers' mental problems and offering help were set up in front of dorm buildings. Leaflets carrying similar information were handed out to each dorm. However, the second suicide came seven days later. Both students were described as men of few words. Their schoolmates didn't see anything to indicate suicide. Zhang revealed that the two students had been bothered by mental disorders. But the school didn't know this until the students' close friends outside school and their parents unveiled the truth after the suicides. According to Zhang, there are only three full-time counselors working in the university's counseling center for its 60,000 students. He complained: \"It's unrealistic to rely only on counselors to detect students' mental problems.\" Some universities in the US may be able to offer solutions to Zhang's worries. They have established programs to train students to be the bridge between troubled friends and counselors. At Worcester Polytechnic Institute, at Worcester, Massachusetts, US, young people in the Student Support Network role play to learn how to detect SOS signals from their schoolmates. They also practice how to gently persuade emotionally troubled students to go for professional help. To develop such empathy , many universities in China have organized campus events to popularize knowledge about mental health. But these are not that attractive to students. Ke Juanjuan, 24, is pursuing a master's degree in English translation at HUST. Ke has found that few of her peers will pay attention to activities about mental health when they are not troubled by it. Rather than bombard students with the words \"mental health\", Ke suggested the school organize lectures and workshops concerning study, job-hunting and relationships. She explained: \"Students care about these topics. They tend to have problems in these areas and may thus get stuck in depression. \"By helping students better deal with these problems, the school can effectively prevent self-inflicted injury and suicide among students.\" Effective prevention comes from long-term education for life instead of temporary intervention to meet an emergency, said Hu Yi'an. Hu delivers a course of lectures on life and death at Guangzhou University. He worries that universities have paid little attention to education for life. \"Education for life helps students respect and love life so they won't resort to ending their lives when they have difficulties,\" said Hu.

{"question": "How much electricity would have been saved without so many people to get divorced?", "context": "Divorce is bad for environment US researchers raised a new theory on Monday: divorce is bad for the environment. The global trend toward higher divorce rates has created more households with fewer people, scientists at Michigan State University reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. More households means more houses, fuel and water are needed for them, the researchers wrote. \"Globally, the number of households is increasing much faster than the number of people,\" said co-author \"Jack\" Liu in a telephone interview. \"Even in regions with declining population, we see an increase in the number of households. Divorce is the main reason for reducing the number of people in a household,\" he said.

The African Development Bank says, \"Aging is highly linked with long-term physical and mental disability and a number of long-term chronic conditions.\" \"Africa is not well prepared to care for its aging population right now. And it needs to prepare for this fact,\" said Professor Mthuli Ncube, the African Development Bank's chief economist. African nations spend far less on healthcare than developed nations do _ about $26 per person per year. Not so many countries have well developed medical aid plans for the elderly, whether they are privately provided plans or indeed government plans. If you look at the pension plans, you will find the pension industries are not well developed in some of the countries. Another challenge for Africa is the worsening of informal systems of social protection. That is cash and support from both the extended family and community sources. The African Development Bank recommends governments help carry out health insurance and pension plans. Ncube said African governments didn't have to handle the health insurance burden alone. \"It is not only a must but also an opportunity for private companies to add their bit in this regard\", he said.

But it's not just the 26 miles and 385 yards that could be a daunting prospect. Some researchers believe that we can find answers to various problems through a more familiar system in which jams appear - road traffic flow. Martin Treiber, of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, has previously developed models for traffic flow. One of the first attempts to model traffic flow was made in the 1950s by James Lighthill and his collaborator Gerard Whitham of Manchester University. They considered the traffic as a kind of liquid flowing down a pipe, and looked at how the flow changes as the fluid gets denser . At first the flow rate increases as the density increases, since you simply get more stuff through in the same period of time. But if the density becomes too high, there's a risk of jams, and the flow rate drops sharply. Treiber has applied his model to the annual Rennsteig half-marathon in central Germany, which attracts around 6,000 participants. The traditional route had to be changed in 2013, because the police were no longer willing to close a road to ensure that runners could cross safely.

A team of researchers at the University of California studied the effects of early exercise on adult physical activity, body mass and eating. They found that early-age exercise in mice has positive effects on adult levels of voluntary exercise in addition to reducing body mass. \"These results may have an effect on the importance of regular physical education in elementary and middle schools,\" said Theodore Garland, a professor of biology, who led the research project. \"If kids exercise regularly through their school years, then they may be more likely to exercise as adults, which could have far-reaching positive effects on human health and well-being.\" His team of researchers found, too, that all mice that had access to early exercise were lighter in weight than non-exercised mice. Garland explained that, in general, exercise will stimulate appetite sooner or later. However, it is possible that certain types of exercise, done for certain periods of time or at certain light levels, might not _ appetite much, if at all, at least in some individuals. \"If we could understand what sorts of exercise these might be, then we might be able to tailor exercise recommendations in a way that would bring the benefits of exercise without increase in appetite, leading to a better chance of weight loss,\" he said.", "qID": "1f70988788c1425fbd470a9bfeda03aa"}
{"question": "What made Amy feel sad when she was staying with her daughter in the hospital?", "context": "Amy Pankratz spent a few nights in the hospital with her daughter, Isabella, who caught a bad flu. While staying there, Amy felt a deep empathy for the difficulties many children and their families were facing. When Isabella was getting well and could leave her room, she wore her prized possession--a \"superhero cape\" Amy had sewn to encourage her--and walked into the hallway. The pink cape was an instant hit with the other young patients, who were doing exercise around the nursing station. \"Then, all the kids were taking turns wearing the cape, giggling,\" Amy says. \"These were some of the same children I had seen looking quite sad the night before, and here they were playing and having fun--kids just being kids!\" From that moment on, Amy began making Comfort Capes for little ones battling with serious illnesses. \"I felt God presenting an opportunity,\" she says. \"I hoped Comfort Capes can help these kids feel brave, to lift some of the fear away.\" Since then, Amy has made and donated more than 5,000 capes in the United States. Amy usually pays for materials herself, although she accepts donations. The capes she makes for kids in treatment are different from those her own children have. Before Amy starts to sew she learns what image or character the little boy or girl connects with. \"I choose the pattern, color and theme specially for each child,\" explains Amy. When she is not sewing, Amy is raising awareness of childhood cancers and looking into ways to get Comfort Capes to more kids who need them, \"If a cape can help a child, even only for a moment, forget his illness, it's worth the time spent sewing,\" she says.", "qID": "183d30b4f3bc4e45979b29081049946b"}

Normally I don't have much money to help him. When my mother is with me, she sometimes makes me pull over and then she will hand him some money. Tonight, I was on my way to the store to get some milk when I saw the man. My daughter and her friend were in the car. We all felt awful that this man was standing out in the cold, wet weather. Many people had made comments that he should be able to work. I often wondered why he would stand out there rather than be in the warmth of a building, working. Well, he might not have an address, and he may need an address in order to apply for a job. Either way, I don't feel it is right to judge. As I was driving, I realized it was getting late and I hurried to the store. But the girls and I were still concerned that he would be cold, standing out in the bad weather. So we got him a hot chocolate and a hamburger. My daughter handed them to him and I told the man that the girl wanted to help him because she was worried about him being cold. He was very sweet and appreciative. We all left with smiles, especially me, because, as we were pulling away, the girls were talking about ways they could raise money to help the man and others like him.

In this week's paper, I outline some of the reasons for why Chinatown's crowded streets and busy shops might be declining. Underneath the surface, Chinatown is falling. And the city, local organizations and businesses are trying to figure out what they can do to turn things around. While numbers of people visit Chinatown, they don't stay long and they don't spend a lot of money. And beyond annual festivals, like Chinese New Years, this month's Moon Festival and last month's Sunday Streets - which drew about 15,000 to 20,000 people - the neighborhood has a hard time attracting locals. Can you remember the last time you went to Chinatown? If you can't, you're not alone. Locals told me that Chinatown doesn't have much to offer them - that the stores are all the same. There are some good eating joints, people said, but they don't know how to find them. Some people even told me that they sometimes go to extreme measures to avoid the neighborhood altogether.

{"question": "What actually saved the elm?", "context": "In the 1950s, a family that owned a farm near Beulah, Michigan kept a bull chained to an elm. The bull paced around the tree, dragging the heavy iron chain, which led to a groove in the bark. The groove deepened over the years. Though for whatever reason, it did not kill the tree. After some years, the family took their bull away. They cut the chain, leaving the loop around the tree and one link hanging down. Then one year, agricultural disaster struck Michigan in the form of Dutch Elm Disease. All of the elms lining the road leading to the farm became infected and died. Everyone thought that the old elm would be the next. The farm owners considered doing the safe thing: pulling it out and cutting it up into firewood before it died. But they simply could not bring themselves to do it. It was as if the old tree had become a family friend. So they decided to let nature take its course. Amazingly, the tree did not die. Nobody could understand why it was the only elm still standing in the county! Plant experts from Michigan State University came out to observe the tree. They continued to study the tree, but could not conclude why it survived while others perished.", "qID": "a429bdb38452449a8077ed6d0ecab8cb"}

After graduation, I had trouble obtaining a job in my initial field of study. For years, I was going from one job to another feeling unfilled, and I was not satisfied with the instability. I decided to go back to school for either International Business or Psychology. I weighed the pros and cons of both professions and Psychology won. I like helping my friends and family, when they go through hard situations in their life by giving them sound advice and being honest with them. Also, I was interested in \"the mind\". I was searching for online schools because my work schedule at my current job would not allow me to attend a regular class. I was nervous about starting online classes because I heard mixed stories from other friends who were taking online classes. I decided to do it anyway to experience something different. I wanted to find an online school that was affordable and reputable. Through my search, I discovered Walden University, which is specially for working adults who want to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher. The process of getting accepted was easy, which included writing an essay on why I wanted to attend their school, transferring my previous credits, etc. I am currently enrolled in the Bachelors program for psychology, and I am paying for college via financial-aid loans and grants. This experience has been interesting yet trying as sometimes it was difficult to balance work, school and home life. I learned a lot about psychology and myself. For example, I like writing about current events, relationships and traveling. I thought my English composition was ordinary, but after taking a few classes at Walden University, I improved my English composition and it made me feel confident enough to start writing professionally so I became a freelance writer.

{"question": "Laws on smoking bans in public places are going stricter in     .", "context": "Smoking bans in public places are linked with falls in childhood asthma attacks and preterm births, according to the biggest analysis of the influence of public smoking bans on child health. The finding should remove fears that such laws could have the opposite effect because they may lead people to smoke more at home. Meanwhile, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Germany, still allow smoking in pubs and restaurants. Only about half of US states have comprehensive bans, and there are few restrictions in poorer nations. Opponents often claim that bans could result in people smoking more at home, which would be worse for their children's health. Asthma is one of the main concerns as second-hand smoke harms children's airways in several ways. Researchers led by Jasper Been at Maastricht University Medical Centre reviewed as many as 11 studies that examined how hospital admissions for childhood asthma and preterm births changed after smoking bans came in. The studies involved more than 2.5 million births, and nearly 250,000 hospital admissions for asthma. The result shows that both asthma admissions and preterm birth rates fell by about 10 percent within a year after smoking restrictions were carried out. The effect on preterm births could also have been caused by pregnant women being more likely to quit or cut down following a public ban, says Been. But Been also says the studies could not completely prove that smoking bans directly caused these changes. However, as a matter of fact, because the analysis included several smoking bans introduced in different countries in different years, and most saw health improvements. Such findings are useful for countries and states where there is ongoing debate about how strict smoking bans should be, especially as hospital care for premature babies is so expensive. This might be one of the most important things to know in order to strengthen legislation. Other studies have shown that rates of heart attack and stroke also tend to fall after smoking bans are introduced.", "qID": "ea4a403dcddb443ebab99c790c6564bb"}
{"question": "How much did the lottery winner lose?", "context": "Do you know of anyone who uses the truth to deceive? When someone tells you something that is true, but leaves out important information that should be included, he can give you a false picture. For example, some might say, 'I just won a hundred dollars on the lottery. It was great. I took that dollar ticket back to the store and turned it in for one hundred dollars!' This guy's a winner, right? Maybe, maybe not. He didn't say anything that was false, but he left out important information on purpose. That's called a half-truth. Half-truths are not technically lies, but they are just as dishonest. Some politicians often use this trick. Let's say that during Governor Smith's last term, her state lost one million jobs and gained three million jobs. Then she seeked another term. One of her opponents said, 'During Governor Smith's term, the state lost one million jobs!' That's true. However, an honest statement would have been, 'During Governor Smith's term, the state had a net gain of two million jobs.' Advertisers will sometimes use half-truths. It's against the law to make false statements so they try to mislead you with the truth. An advertisement might say, 'Nine out of ten doctors advised their patients to take Yucky Pills to cure toothache.' It fails to mention that they only asked ten doctors and nine of them work for the Yucky Company. This kind of deception happens too often.

{"question": "What is true according to the passage?", "context": "Human beings have a natural desire to explore the unknown. People with a strong interest in space like to say it is the last place left to explore. But scientists are warning that space exploration for long periods is not going to be easy. They say the human body is not designed to stay in space over an extended period. The New York Times recently published a report about scientists who are preparing astronauts for a trip to the Moon. The newspaper said the scientists want to make sure that their crews return home in good health. But there are many problems to be solved before people are ready for long trips to the Moon, an asteroid or even the planet Mars. Humans developed on a planet with a surface that is more than 70 percent water. Our bodies are also about 70 percent water. When there is no gravity that water moves up toward the head, raising pressure in the skull. Arms and legs grow weaker at what is called zero gravity because they no longer need to push against the force of gravity. Five years ago, astronauts who spent weeks in space reported a change in their eyesight. These astronauts were members of the crew on the International Space Station. Research showed a change in the shape of their eyes. Normally-round eyeballs had become flat during time in space. However, the research did not specify any particular differences between individuals based on gender or other factors. Bone loss was one of the problems first reported by astronauts returning to Earth after longer stays in space. So scientists designed exercise machines to use on the space station. Tests showed that the exercise equipment helped space travelers keep their bones almost as strong as when they left Earth. There are other health issues for astronauts who spend a long time in space. They may have problems eating and sleeping. But the biggest health issue is exposure to radiation. On Earth, human beings are protected by the atmosphere and the planet's magnetic field.

It must be about something which both people have the same opinion about. The purpose of small talk is to let both people agree on something. This makes meeting people easier and more comfortable. But people often disagree about religion or politics so these are not suitable topics for small talk. The topics for small talk also depend on where the conversation is taking place.

But it is not a distant childhood memory. The words come back to you as clearly as when you sang them all those years ago. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh studied the relationship between music and remembering a foreign language. They found that remembering words in a song was the best way to remember even one of the most difficult languages. Here is what they did. Researchers took 60 adults and randomly divided them into three groups of 20. Then they gave the groups three different types of \"listen-and-repeat\" learning conditions. Researchers had one group simply speak the words. They had the second group speak the words to a rhythm, or beat. And they asked the third group to sing the words. All three groups studied words from a less commonly known European language for 15 minutes. Then they took part in a series of language tests to see what they remembered. After the tests were over, the singers came out on top. The people who learned these new words by singing them showed a higher overall performance. They did the best in four out of five of the tests. They also performed two times better than those who simply learned the words by speaking them. Dr. Katie Overy says singing could lead to new ways to learn a foreign language. The brain likes to remember things when they are contained in a catchy 3, or memorable 4, tune 5. Dr. Ludke said the findings could help those who struggle to learn foreign languages.

Since 2000, the CDC has made efforts with goals of getting 75% of Americans to eat two or more servings of fruit a day and 50% of Americans to eat three or more servings of vegetables a day. Unfortunately, Americans aren't meeting these modest targets. Although a diet high in fruit and vegetables can reduce the risk of many diseases, Americans just aren't getting enough. The CDC also finds that only about a third of adults are eating their expected servings of fruit, and just over a quarter of adults are eating their expected servings of vegetables. So why aren't Americans getting their expected servings of fruit and vegetables? It turns out that Americans might be spoiled when it comes to their produce. A national survey conducted by Fruit2day reveals that nearly half of Americans leave fruit in their fridges until it rots, but specific cities were not mentioned in the survey.

{"question": "Was Paraguay's hotel occupancy rate higher in 2003 or 2004?", "context": "Paraguay has a small tourism industry. Total tourism receipts declined annually from 2000 through 2002. Small gains in tourism have come from business rather than leisure travellers. For many years, Paraguay served as a central market for trafficable, duty-free goods. However, crackdowns by the governments of Brazil and Argentina have stemmed the flow of shoppers travelling to Paraguay looking for trafficable items. Paraguay is a country that has a lot of different activities for tourism, due to privileged weather and location conditions condensed into a varied geography, an inviting \"warm\" tropical climate and an interesting history and unmatched folk art that adorn its streets with an identity that enchants anyone who visits the country. As an example, for less than 80 US dollars a visitor can have a personalized trip to a nature reserve area called Eco-Reserva Mbatovi which is located in the Paraguari department, about an hour away from the capital. The trip includes a bunch of different outdoor activities, water, and complete professional guidance during the whole trip.", "qID": "788a251fc39d4e4ba6aae09946feb276"}
{"question": "Who refused to submit to Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar and the emperor?", "context": "Meanwhile, in 1274, the former Dali Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of Yunnan, with Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar as governor. In May 1275, the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned. He also reported difficulties in managing the local resistance, but did not specify which groups or regions were involved. The emperor rejected an outright invasion of the unspecified regions. Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if any regional power contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275-76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276. By 1277, at least one vassal state had submitted to the Mongols. Like in 1272, the government of a neighboring state sent an army to reclaim a rebellious state; but unlike in 1272, the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there. Though it was ultimately under Mongol command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were Turkic-speaking peoples or people from the further west: Turks from Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv and Nishapur, but also captive soldiers from the Persian Khwarazmid empire, the Kipchaks, and even Bulgars from the lower Volga.", "qID": "a2cb1abaa448433a860f136dd0c5383c"}

The death of a key figure in fall of 1576 weakened Danzig's position, making the conflict less about the recognition of the ruler than about Danzig's privileges.

{"question": "What did Piet Heyn get?", "context": "In the Atlantic, the West India Company concentrated on wresting from Portugal its grip on the sugar and slave trade, and on opportunistic attacks on the Spanish treasure fleets on their homeward bound voyage. Bahia on the north east coast of Brazil was captured in 1624 but only held for a year before it was recaptured by a joint Spanish-Portuguese expedition. In 1628, Piet Heyn intercepted a Spanish fleet, though the contents of this fleet were not documented. In 1630, the Dutch occupied the Portuguese sugar-settlement of Pernambuco and over the next few years pushed inland, annexing the sugar plantations that surrounded it. In order to supply the plantations with the manpower they required, a successful expedition was launched in 1637 from Brazil to capture the Portuguese slaving post of Elmina, and in 1641 successfully captured the Portuguese settlements in Angola. In 1642, the Dutch captured the Portuguese possession of Axim in Africa.

Many were stretched until their limbs broke; sophisticated iron thumbscrews were applied to the fingers and toes of some prisoners; while other had their backs slowly roasted or had their flanks and bare feet slowly torn apart with red-hot iron pincers. Peter thus induced suspect after suspect to name accomplices in a virtually unending cavalcade of forced, and likely often fake, confessions.

Siam very much remained a thorn to the stability of Burmese peripheral regions. In the following years, Siam continued to provide support to rebels in the south and those in Lan Na in the north. The only lasting territorial gain the Burmese achieved was the upper Tenasserim coast, on which they previously had only a nominal claim. Although the Siamese troops no longer openly intruded the border, rebels continued to operate from the Siamese territory. In 1764, a governor in Tavoy, who was appointed by Alaungpaya four years earlier, revolted until it was put down in November 1764.
