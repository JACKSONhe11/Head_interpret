A wide and apparently an impervious\nboundary of forests severed the possessions of the hostile provinces of\nFrance and England. The hardy colonist, and the trained European who\nfought at his side, frequently expended months in struggling against the\nrapids of the streams, or in effecting the rugged passes of the\nmountains, in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more\nmartial conflict. But, emulating the patience and self-denial of the\npractised native warriors, they learned to overcome every difficulty;\nand it would seem that, in time, there was no recess of the woods so\ndark, nor any secret place so lovely, that it might claim exemption from\nthe inroads of those who had pledged their blood to satiate their\nvengeance, or to uphold the cold and selfish policy of the distant\nmonarchs of Europe.\n\nPerhaps no district throughout the wide extent of the intermediate\nfrontiers can furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness\nof the savage warfare of those periods than the country which lies\nbetween the head waters of the Hudson and the adjacent lakes.\n\nThe facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the\ncombatants were too obvious to be neglected.
